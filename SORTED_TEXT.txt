'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.'
'Tis thee (my self) that for my self I praise,
'Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed,
'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,
'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept,
'Too young' and next year' and "Tis too early.'
'Twill be two days ere I shall see you; so
'Tis bitter.
'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;
'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves;
'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour:
'Twixt these extremes at all.
'Tis sport to maul a runner.
'Tis well th'art gone,
'Tis the last service that I shall command you.
'This is no flattery; these are counsellors
'Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look
'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine;
'Twixt the souls of friend and friend;
'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well.  
'Tis I must make conclusion
'Tis Hymen peoples every town;
'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
'The pig' quoth I 'is burn'd'; 'My gold!' quoth he.
'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed
'Tis holy sport to be a little vain
'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.
'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he
'That I receive the general food at first
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
'Tis south the city mills- bring me word thither
'Twere a perpetual spoil; and till we call'd  
'Tis warm at's heart.
'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise'; dismiss'd me
'This we receiv'd,' and each in either side
'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
'Twixt fair and foul?
'Twixt two such shes, would chatter this way and
'To th' tender of our present.
'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,
'Tis true- nay, keep the ring, 'tis true. I am sure
'Twixt hour and hour?
'Tis in my cloak-bag- doublet, hat, hose, all
'Tis time must do. Beseech your Majesty,
'Tis almost night; you shall have better cheer
'Tis the ninth hour o' th' morn.
'Twould move me sooner.
'Twas very Cloten.
'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,
'Tis he and Cloten; malice and lucre in them
'Two boys, an old man (twice a boy), a lane,
'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,  
'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.
'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it.
'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;
'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen
'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?
'Twixt amorous and villainous. Being thus quench'd
'Tis strange.
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'
'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:
'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
'Tis now the very witching time of night,
'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,  
'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
'Thus didest thou.'
'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
'Twas where the madcap Duke his uncle kept-
'Tis like the forc'd gait of a shuffling nag,
'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.
'Tis a point of friendship.
'Tis not ten years gone
'The time shall come'- thus did he follow it-
'The time will come that foul sin, gathering head,
'Tis needful that the most immodest word
'Tis merry in hall when beards wag an;
'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,  
'Tis a hooded valour, and when it appears it will bate.
'Tis not the balm, the sceptre, and the ball,
'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions, lords,
'Twas I, indeed, thou promised'st to strike,
'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.
'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
'Twas full of darnel-do you like the taste?
'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands;
'Tis but the short'ning of my life one day.
'Thou maiden youth, be vanquish'd by a maid.'
'Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt
'Twas neither Charles nor yet the Duke I nam'd,
'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,
'Tis known to you he is mine enemy;
'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.
'The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;
'Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?'
'Tis like, my lord, you will not keep your hour.
'Tis that they seek; and they, in seeking that,
'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,
'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.
'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your Grace.
'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.
'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd,
'Twas men I lack'd, and you will give them me;
'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend;
'Tis but surmis'd whiles thou art standing by,
'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence;
'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,
'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
'Tis virtue that doth make them most admir'd;  
'Tis government that makes them seem divine;
'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,
'Tis not his new-made bride shall succour him;
'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong;
'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.
'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.
'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.
'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity.
'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better.
'Twas said they saw but one, and no discerner
'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake
'Twould prove the verity of certain words
'T has done, upon the premises, but justice.
'Tis full of woe; yet I can give you inkling
'The horses your lordship sent for, with all the care
'Tis sweet at first t' acquire-after this process,
'Tis now the King's, and called Whitehall.
'Tis like a pardon after execution:
'Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take't of me-
'Tis his aspect of terror. All's not well.
'Tis well there's one above 'em yet. I had thought
'Tis my undoing. Love and meekness, lord,
'Twould fall upon ourselves.
'Tis ten to one this play can never please
'Tis too respective and too sociable
'Tis not the roundure of your old-fac'd walls  
'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,
'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
'Tis better that the enemy seek us;
'Tis three o'clock, and Romans, yet ere night
'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
'Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think,
'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
'To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.
'Tis from your sister.
'The fiend, the fiend'- he led me to that place.
'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord,
'Tis past, and so am I.- But what art thou
'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
'Tis won as towns with fire- so won, so lost.
'Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,  
'Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
'Thus must thou speak' and 'thus thy body bear,'
'Tu-who;
'Tu-who;
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
'Twixt this and supper. Go not my horse the better,
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
'Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;
'Tis hard to reconcile.
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
'Twixt you and your poor brother.
'Tis not the devil's crest.  
'Tis best that thou diest quickly.
'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
'Tis that he sent me of the Duke's return.
'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.
'Tis nine o'clock; our friends all stay for you;
'The fire seven times tried this;
'Tween snow and fire as treason and my love.
'Tween man and man; but thou, thou meagre lead,
'The slaves are ours.' So do I answer you:
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
'Twere good you do so much for charity.
'Tis true. My name is Nym, and Falstaff loves your wife.
'Tis old but true: Still swine eats all the draff.      Exit
'The raging rocks
'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,
'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
'Tis certain so. The Prince wooes for himself.
'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.
'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.
'Tis oft with difference- yet do they all confirm
'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful.
'Twere now to be most happy; for I fear
'Tis pride that pulls the country down;
'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,
'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?
'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;
'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.
'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.
'Tis gone.
'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword; he dies.
'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.
'Twas I that kill'd her.  
'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.
'Tis in reversion that I do possess-
'Tis doubt he will be. Letters came last night  
'Tis very true: my grief lies all within;
'Tis nothing but some bond that he is ent'red into
'Tis full three months since I did see him last.
'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower;
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
'Tis time to speak-my pains are quite forgot.
'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.
'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
'Tis more than we deserve or I expect.
'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
'Thus saith the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferr'd'-
'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I
'This general applause and cheerful shout
'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest 'girdling one another
'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
'Tis not yet near day. Come, go with me;
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
'To seek him here that means not to be found.
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'
'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
'Tis now near night.
'Then music with her silver sound
'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well.  
'Tis hatch'd, and shall be so. Tranio, at once
'Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen,
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
'Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both
'Tis in my head to do my master good:
'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom
'Tis marvel- but that you are but newly come,
'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here.
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
'Twere good he were school'd.
'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
'Tis true, my brother's daughter's Queen of Tunis;
'Twould put me to my slipper; but I feel not
'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,
'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,
'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;
'Tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;
'Twere sure enough.
'Tis necessary he should die:
'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect:
'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;
'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler
'Tis thou that rig'st the bark and plough'st the foam,
'Tis thou and those that have dishonoured me.
'Tis not the difference of a year or two
'Tis policy and stratagem must do
'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning,
'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.
'Tis not an hour since I left them there.
'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;
'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,
'To Saturn,' Caius- not to Saturnine:
'Tis he the common people love so much;
'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;
'Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus;  
'Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.
'Tis true, 'tis true: witness my knife's sharp point.
'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage-
'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquar'd,
'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,
'Tis dry enough-will with great speed of judgment,
'Twixt right and wrong; for pleasure and revenge
'Tis said he holds you well; and will be led
'Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss.
'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,
'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love
'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.
'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover.
'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.
'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,
'To her let us garlands bring.
'Tis pity love should be so contrary;
'Tis true; for Friar Lawrence met them both
'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.
'This is put forth too truly.' Besides, I have stay'd  
'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
'Tis none of mine.  
'Tis past enduring.
'Tis pity she's not honest- honourable.'
'Tis hop'd his sickness is discharg'd.
'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
'Tis rigour, and not law. Your honours all,
'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness- th' one
'Tis not a visitation fram'd, but forc'd
'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;
'Tis promised in the charity of age.
'That he did in the general bosom reign
'This said, his wat'ry eyes he did dismount,  
'That not a heart which in his level came
'Thus merely with the garment of a Grace  
'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.'
'Tis thee (my self) that for my self I praise,
'Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed,
'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,
'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept,
'Too young' and next year' and "Tis too early.'
'Twill be two days ere I shall see you; so
'Tis bitter.
'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;
'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves;
'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour:
'Twixt these extremes at all.
'Tis sport to maul a runner.
'Tis well th'art gone,
'Tis the last service that I shall command you.
'This is no flattery; these are counsellors
'Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look
'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine;
'Twixt the souls of friend and friend;
'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well.  
'Tis I must make conclusion
'Tis Hymen peoples every town;
'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
'The pig' quoth I 'is burn'd'; 'My gold!' quoth he.
'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed
'Tis holy sport to be a little vain
'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.
'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he
'That I receive the general food at first
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
'Tis south the city mills- bring me word thither
'Twere a perpetual spoil; and till we call'd  
'Tis warm at's heart.
'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise'; dismiss'd me
'This we receiv'd,' and each in either side
'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
'Twixt fair and foul?
'Twixt two such shes, would chatter this way and
'To th' tender of our present.
'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,
'Tis true- nay, keep the ring, 'tis true. I am sure
'Twixt hour and hour?
'Tis in my cloak-bag- doublet, hat, hose, all
'Tis time must do. Beseech your Majesty,
'Tis almost night; you shall have better cheer
'Tis the ninth hour o' th' morn.
'Twould move me sooner.
'Twas very Cloten.
'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,
'Tis he and Cloten; malice and lucre in them
'Two boys, an old man (twice a boy), a lane,
'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,  
'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.
'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it.
'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;
'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen
'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?
'Twixt amorous and villainous. Being thus quench'd
'Tis strange.
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'
'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:
'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
'Tis now the very witching time of night,
'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,  
'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
'Thus didest thou.'
'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
'Twas where the madcap Duke his uncle kept-
'Tis like the forc'd gait of a shuffling nag,
'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.
'Tis a point of friendship.
'Tis not ten years gone
'The time shall come'- thus did he follow it-
'The time will come that foul sin, gathering head,
'Tis needful that the most immodest word
'Tis merry in hall when beards wag an;
'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,  
'Tis a hooded valour, and when it appears it will bate.
'Tis not the balm, the sceptre, and the ball,
'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions, lords,
'Twas I, indeed, thou promised'st to strike,
'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.
'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
'Twas full of darnel-do you like the taste?
'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands;
'Tis but the short'ning of my life one day.
'Thou maiden youth, be vanquish'd by a maid.'
'Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt
'Twas neither Charles nor yet the Duke I nam'd,
'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,
'Tis known to you he is mine enemy;
'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.
'The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;
'Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?'
'Tis like, my lord, you will not keep your hour.
'Tis that they seek; and they, in seeking that,
'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,
'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.
'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your Grace.
'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.
'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd,
'Twas men I lack'd, and you will give them me;
'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend;
'Tis but surmis'd whiles thou art standing by,
'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence;
'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,
'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
'Tis virtue that doth make them most admir'd;  
'Tis government that makes them seem divine;
'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,
'Tis not his new-made bride shall succour him;
'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong;
'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.
'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.
'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.
'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity.
'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better.
'Twas said they saw but one, and no discerner
'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake
'Twould prove the verity of certain words
'T has done, upon the premises, but justice.
'Tis full of woe; yet I can give you inkling
'The horses your lordship sent for, with all the care
'Tis sweet at first t' acquire-after this process,
'Tis now the King's, and called Whitehall.
'Tis like a pardon after execution:
'Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take't of me-
'Tis his aspect of terror. All's not well.
'Tis well there's one above 'em yet. I had thought
'Tis my undoing. Love and meekness, lord,
'Twould fall upon ourselves.
'Tis ten to one this play can never please
'Tis too respective and too sociable
'Tis not the roundure of your old-fac'd walls  
'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,
'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
'Tis better that the enemy seek us;
'Tis three o'clock, and Romans, yet ere night
'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
'Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think,
'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
'To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.
'Tis from your sister.
'The fiend, the fiend'- he led me to that place.
'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord,
'Tis past, and so am I.- But what art thou
'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
'Tis won as towns with fire- so won, so lost.
'Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,  
'Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
'Thus must thou speak' and 'thus thy body bear,'
'Tu-who;
'Tu-who;
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
'Twixt this and supper. Go not my horse the better,
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
'Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;
'Tis hard to reconcile.
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
'Twixt you and your poor brother.
'Tis not the devil's crest.  
'Tis best that thou diest quickly.
'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
'Tis that he sent me of the Duke's return.
'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.
'Tis nine o'clock; our friends all stay for you;
'The fire seven times tried this;
'Tween snow and fire as treason and my love.
'Tween man and man; but thou, thou meagre lead,
'The slaves are ours.' So do I answer you:
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
'Twere good you do so much for charity.
'Tis true. My name is Nym, and Falstaff loves your wife.
'Tis old but true: Still swine eats all the draff.      Exit
'The raging rocks
'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,
'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
'Tis certain so. The Prince wooes for himself.
'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.
'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.
'Tis oft with difference- yet do they all confirm
'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful.
'Twere now to be most happy; for I fear
'Tis pride that pulls the country down;
'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,
'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?
'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;
'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.
'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.
'Tis gone.
'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword; he dies.
'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.
'Twas I that kill'd her.  
'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.
'Tis in reversion that I do possess-
'Tis doubt he will be. Letters came last night  
'Tis very true: my grief lies all within;
'Tis nothing but some bond that he is ent'red into
'Tis full three months since I did see him last.
'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower;
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
'Tis time to speak-my pains are quite forgot.
'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.
'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
'Tis more than we deserve or I expect.
'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
'Thus saith the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferr'd'-
'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I
'This general applause and cheerful shout
'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest 'girdling one another
'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
'Tis not yet near day. Come, go with me;
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
'To seek him here that means not to be found.
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'
'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
'Tis now near night.
'Then music with her silver sound
'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well.  
'Tis hatch'd, and shall be so. Tranio, at once
'Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen,
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
'Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both
'Tis in my head to do my master good:
'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom
'Tis marvel- but that you are but newly come,
'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here.
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
'Twere good he were school'd.
'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
'Tis true, my brother's daughter's Queen of Tunis;
'Twould put me to my slipper; but I feel not
'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,
'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,
'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;
'Tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;
'Twere sure enough.
'Tis necessary he should die:
'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect:
'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;
'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler
'Tis thou that rig'st the bark and plough'st the foam,
'Tis thou and those that have dishonoured me.
'Tis not the difference of a year or two
'Tis policy and stratagem must do
'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning,
'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.
'Tis not an hour since I left them there.
'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;
'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,
'To Saturn,' Caius- not to Saturnine:
'Tis he the common people love so much;
'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;
'Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus;  
'Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.
'Tis true, 'tis true: witness my knife's sharp point.
'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage-
'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquar'd,
'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,
'Tis dry enough-will with great speed of judgment,
'Twixt right and wrong; for pleasure and revenge
'Tis said he holds you well; and will be led
'Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss.
'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,
'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love
'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.
'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover.
'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.
'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,

'This is put forth too truly.' Besides, I have stay'd  
'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs

'Tis past enduring.
'Tis pity she's not honest- honourable.'
'Tis hop'd his sickness is discharg'd.
'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
'Tis rigour, and not law. Your honours all,
'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness- th' one
'Tis not a visitation fram'd, but forc'd

'Tis thee (my self) that for my self I praise,

'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest 'girdling one another
'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
'Tis not yet near day. Come, go with me;
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
'To seek him here that means not to be found.
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'
'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
'Tis now near night.
'Then music with her silver sound
'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well.  
'Tis hatch'd, and shall be so. Tranio, at once
'Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen,
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
'Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both
'Tis in my head to do my master good:
'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom
'Tis marvel- but that you are but newly come,
'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here.
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
'Twere good he were school'd.
'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
'Tis true, my brother's daughter's Queen of Tunis;
'Twould put me to my slipper; but I feel not
'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,
'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,
'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;
'Tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;
'Twere sure enough.
'Tis necessary he should die:
'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect:
'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;
'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler
'Tis thou that rig'st the bark and plough'st the foam,
'Tis thou and those that have dishonoured me.
'Tis not the difference of a year or two
'Tis policy and stratagem must do
'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning,
'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.
'Tis not an hour since I left them there.
'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;
'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,
'To Saturn,' Caius- not to Saturnine:
'Tis he the common people love so much;
'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;
'Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus;  
'Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.
'Tis true, 'tis true: witness my knife's sharp point.
'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage-
'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquar'd,
'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,
'Tis dry enough-will with great speed of judgment,
'Twixt right and wrong; for pleasure and revenge
'Tis said he holds you well; and will be led
'Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss.
'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,
'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love
'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.
'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover.
'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.
'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,
'To her let us garlands bring.
'Tis pity love should be so contrary;
'Tis true; for Friar Lawrence met them both
'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.
'This is put forth too truly.' Besides, I have stay'd  
'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
'Tis none of mine.  
'Tis past enduring.
'Tis pity she's not honest- honourable.'
'Tis hop'd his sickness is discharg'd.
'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
'Tis rigour, and not law. Your honours all,
'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness- th' one
'Tis not a visitation fram'd, but forc'd
'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;
'Tis promised in the charity of age.
'That he did in the general bosom reign
'This said, his wat'ry eyes he did dismount,  
'That not a heart which in his level came
'Thus merely with the garment of a Grace  
'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.'
'Tis thee (my self) that for my self I praise,
'Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed,
'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,
'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept,
'Too young' and next year' and "Tis too early.'
'Twill be two days ere I shall see you; so
'Tis bitter.
'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;
'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves;
'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour:
'Twixt these extremes at all.
'Tis sport to maul a runner.
'Tis well th'art gone,
'Tis the last service that I shall command you.
'This is no flattery; these are counsellors
'Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look
'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine;
'Twixt the souls of friend and friend;
'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well.  
'Tis I must make conclusion
'Tis Hymen peoples every town;
'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
'The pig' quoth I 'is burn'd'; 'My gold!' quoth he.
'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed
'Tis holy sport to be a little vain
'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.
'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he
'That I receive the general food at first
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
'Tis south the city mills- bring me word thither
'Twere a perpetual spoil; and till we call'd  
'Tis warm at's heart.
'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise'; dismiss'd me
'This we receiv'd,' and each in either side
'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
'Twixt fair and foul?
'Twixt two such shes, would chatter this way and
'To th' tender of our present.
'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,
'Tis true- nay, keep the ring, 'tis true. I am sure
'Twixt hour and hour?
'Tis in my cloak-bag- doublet, hat, hose, all
'Tis time must do. Beseech your Majesty,
'Tis almost night; you shall have better cheer
'Tis the ninth hour o' th' morn.
'Twould move me sooner.
'Twas very Cloten.
'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,
'Tis he and Cloten; malice and lucre in them
'Two boys, an old man (twice a boy), a lane,
'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,  
'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.
'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it.
'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;
'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen
'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?
'Twixt amorous and villainous. Being thus quench'd
'Tis strange.
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'
'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:
'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
'Tis now the very witching time of night,
'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,  
'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
'Thus didest thou.'
'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
'Twas where the madcap Duke his uncle kept-
'Tis like the forc'd gait of a shuffling nag,
'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.
'Tis a point of friendship.
'Tis not ten years gone
'The time shall come'- thus did he follow it-
'The time will come that foul sin, gathering head,
'Tis needful that the most immodest word
'Tis merry in hall when beards wag an;
'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,  
'Tis a hooded valour, and when it appears it will bate.
'Tis not the balm, the sceptre, and the ball,
'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions, lords,
'Twas I, indeed, thou promised'st to strike,
'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.
'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
'Twas full of darnel-do you like the taste?
'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands;
'Tis but the short'ning of my life one day.
'Thou maiden youth, be vanquish'd by a maid.'
'Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt
'Twas neither Charles nor yet the Duke I nam'd,
'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,
'Tis known to you he is mine enemy;
'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.
'The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;
'Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?'
'Tis like, my lord, you will not keep your hour.
'Tis that they seek; and they, in seeking that,
'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,
'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.
'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your Grace.
'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.
'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd,
'Twas men I lack'd, and you will give them me;
'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend;
'Tis but surmis'd whiles thou art standing by,
'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence;
'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,
'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
'Tis virtue that doth make them most admir'd;  
'Tis government that makes them seem divine;
'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,
'Tis not his new-made bride shall succour him;
'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong;
'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.
'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.
'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.
'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity.
'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better.
'Twas said they saw but one, and no discerner
'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake
'Twould prove the verity of certain words
'T has done, upon the premises, but justice.
'Tis full of woe; yet I can give you inkling
'The horses your lordship sent for, with all the care
'Tis sweet at first t' acquire-after this process,
'Tis now the King's, and called Whitehall.
'Tis like a pardon after execution:
'Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take't of me-
'Tis his aspect of terror. All's not well.
'Tis well there's one above 'em yet. I had thought
'Tis my undoing. Love and meekness, lord,
'Twould fall upon ourselves.
'Tis ten to one this play can never please
'Tis too respective and too sociable
'Tis not the roundure of your old-fac'd walls  
'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,
'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
'Tis better that the enemy seek us;
'Tis three o'clock, and Romans, yet ere night
'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
'Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think,
'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
'To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.
'Tis from your sister.
'The fiend, the fiend'- he led me to that place.
'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord,
'Tis past, and so am I.- But what art thou
'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
'Tis won as towns with fire- so won, so lost.
'Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,  
'Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
'Thus must thou speak' and 'thus thy body bear,'
'Tu-who;
'Tu-who;
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
'Twixt this and supper. Go not my horse the better,
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
'Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;
'Tis hard to reconcile.
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
'Twixt you and your poor brother.
'Tis not the devil's crest.  
'Tis best that thou diest quickly.
'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
'Tis that he sent me of the Duke's return.
'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.
'Tis nine o'clock; our friends all stay for you;
'The fire seven times tried this;
'Tween snow and fire as treason and my love.
'Tween man and man; but thou, thou meagre lead,
'The slaves are ours.' So do I answer you:
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
'Twere good you do so much for charity.
'Tis true. My name is Nym, and Falstaff loves your wife.
'Tis old but true: Still swine eats all the draff.      Exit
'The raging rocks
'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,
'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
'Tis certain so. The Prince wooes for himself.
'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.
'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.
'Tis oft with difference- yet do they all confirm
'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful.
'Twere now to be most happy; for I fear
'Tis pride that pulls the country down;
'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,
'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?
'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;
'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.
'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.
'Tis gone.
'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword; he dies.
'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.
'Twas I that kill'd her.  
'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.
'Tis in reversion that I do possess-
'Tis doubt he will be. Letters came last night  
'Tis very true: my grief lies all within;
'Tis nothing but some bond that he is ent'red into
'Tis full three months since I did see him last.
'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower;
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
'Tis time to speak-my pains are quite forgot.
'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.
'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
'Tis more than we deserve or I expect.
'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
'Thus saith the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferr'd'-
'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I
'This general applause and cheerful shout
'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest 'girdling one another
'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
'Tis not yet near day. Come, go with me;
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
'To seek him here that means not to be found.
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'
'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
'Tis now near night.
'Then music with her silver sound
'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well.  
'Tis hatch'd, and shall be so. Tranio, at once

'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom
'Tis marvel- but that you are but newly come,
'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here.
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
'Twere good he were school'd.
'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd

'Thus must thou speak' and 'thus thy body bear,'
'Tu-who;
'Tu-who;
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
'Twixt this and supper. Go not my horse the better,
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
'Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;
'Tis hard to reconcile.
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
'Twixt you and your poor brother.
'Tis not the devil's crest.  
'Tis best that thou diest quickly.
'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
'Tis that he sent me of the Duke's return.
'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.
'Tis nine o'clock; our friends all stay for you;
'The fire seven times tried this;
'Tween snow and fire as treason and my love.
'Tween man and man; but thou, thou meagre lead,
'The slaves are ours.' So do I answer you:
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
'Twere good you do so much for charity.
'Tis true. My name is Nym, and Falstaff loves your wife.
'Tis old but true: Still swine eats all the draff.      Exit
'The raging rocks
'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,
'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
'Tis certain so. The Prince wooes for himself.
'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.
'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.
'Tis oft with difference- yet do they all confirm
'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful.
'Twere now to be most happy; for I fear
'Tis pride that pulls the country down;
'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,
'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?
'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;
'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.
'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.
'Tis gone.
'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword; he dies.
'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.
'Twas I that kill'd her.  
'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.
'Tis in reversion that I do possess-
'Tis doubt he will be. Letters came last night  
'Tis very true: my grief lies all within;
'Tis nothing but some bond that he is ent'red into
'Tis full three months since I did see him last.
'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower;
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
'Tis time to speak-my pains are quite forgot.
'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.
'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
'Tis more than we deserve or I expect.
'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
'Thus saith the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferr'd'-
'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I
'This general applause and cheerful shout
'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest 'girdling one another
'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
'Tis not yet near day. Come, go with me;
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
'To seek him here that means not to be found.
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'
'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
'Tis now near night.
'Then music with her silver sound
'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well.  
'Tis hatch'd, and shall be so. Tranio, at once
'Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen,
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
'Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both
'Tis in my head to do my master good:
'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom
'Tis marvel- but that you are but newly come,
'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here.
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
'Twere good he were school'd.
'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
'Tis true, my brother's daughter's Queen of Tunis;
'Twould put me to my slipper; but I feel not
'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,
'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,
'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;
'Tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;
'Twere sure enough.
'Tis necessary he should die:
'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect:
'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;
'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler
'Tis thou that rig'st the bark and plough'st the foam,
'Tis thou and those that have dishonoured me.
'Tis not the difference of a year or two
'Tis policy and stratagem must do
'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning,
'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.
'Tis not an hour since I left them there.
'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;
'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,
'To Saturn,' Caius- not to Saturnine:
'Tis he the common people love so much;
'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;
'Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus;  
'Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.
'Tis true, 'tis true: witness my knife's sharp point.
'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage-
'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquar'd,
'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,
'Tis dry enough-will with great speed of judgment,
'Twixt right and wrong; for pleasure and revenge
'Tis said he holds you well; and will be led
'Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss.
'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,
'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love
'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.
'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover.
'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.
'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,
'To her let us garlands bring.
'Tis pity love should be so contrary;
'Tis true; for Friar Lawrence met them both
'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.
'This is put forth too truly.' Besides, I have stay'd  
'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
'Tis none of mine.  
'Tis past enduring.
'Tis pity she's not honest- honourable.'
'Tis hop'd his sickness is discharg'd.
'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
'Tis rigour, and not law. Your honours all,
'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness- th' one
'Tis not a visitation fram'd, but forc'd
'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;
'Tis promised in the charity of age.
'That he did in the general bosom reign
'This said, his wat'ry eyes he did dismount,  
'That not a heart which in his level came
'Thus merely with the garment of a Grace  
'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.'
'Tis thee (my self) that for my self I praise,
'Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed,
'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,
'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept,
'Too young' and next year' and "Tis too early.'
'Twill be two days ere I shall see you; so
'Tis bitter.
'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;
'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves;
'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour:
'Twixt these extremes at all.
'Tis sport to maul a runner.
'Tis well th'art gone,
'Tis the last service that I shall command you.
'This is no flattery; these are counsellors
'Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look
'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine;
'Twixt the souls of friend and friend;
'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well.  
'Tis I must make conclusion
'Tis Hymen peoples every town;
'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
'The pig' quoth I 'is burn'd'; 'My gold!' quoth he.
'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed
'Tis holy sport to be a little vain
'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.
'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he
'That I receive the general food at first
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
'Tis south the city mills- bring me word thither
'Twere a perpetual spoil; and till we call'd  
'Tis warm at's heart.
'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise'; dismiss'd me
'This we receiv'd,' and each in either side
'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
'Twixt fair and foul?
'Twixt two such shes, would chatter this way and
'To th' tender of our present.
'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,
'Tis true- nay, keep the ring, 'tis true. I am sure
'Twixt hour and hour?
'Tis in my cloak-bag- doublet, hat, hose, all
'Tis time must do. Beseech your Majesty,
'Tis almost night; you shall have better cheer
'Tis the ninth hour o' th' morn.
'Twould move me sooner.
'Twas very Cloten.
'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,
'Tis he and Cloten; malice and lucre in them
'Two boys, an old man (twice a boy), a lane,
'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,  
'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.
'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it.
'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;
'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen
'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?
'Twixt amorous and villainous. Being thus quench'd
'Tis strange.
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'
'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:
'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
'Tis now the very witching time of night,
'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,  
'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
'Thus didest thou.'
'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
'Twas where the madcap Duke his uncle kept-
'Tis like the forc'd gait of a shuffling nag,
'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.
'Tis a point of friendship.
'Tis not ten years gone
'The time shall come'- thus did he follow it-
'The time will come that foul sin, gathering head,
'Tis needful that the most immodest word
'Tis merry in hall when beards wag an;
'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,  
'Tis a hooded valour, and when it appears it will bate.
'Tis not the balm, the sceptre, and the ball,
'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions, lords,
'Twas I, indeed, thou promised'st to strike,
'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.
'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
'Twas full of darnel-do you like the taste?
'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands;
'Tis but the short'ning of my life one day.
'Thou maiden youth, be vanquish'd by a maid.'
'Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt
'Twas neither Charles nor yet the Duke I nam'd,
'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,
'Tis known to you he is mine enemy;
'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.
'The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;
'Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?'
'Tis like, my lord, you will not keep your hour.
'Tis that they seek; and they, in seeking that,
'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,
'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.
'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your Grace.
'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.
'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd,
'Twas men I lack'd, and you will give them me;
'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend;
'Tis but surmis'd whiles thou art standing by,
'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence;
'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,
'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
'Tis virtue that doth make them most admir'd;  
'Tis government that makes them seem divine;
'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,
'Tis not his new-made bride shall succour him;
'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong;
'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.
'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.
'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.
'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity.
'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better.
'Twas said they saw but one, and no discerner
'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake
'Twould prove the verity of certain words
'T has done, upon the premises, but justice.
'Tis full of woe; yet I can give you inkling
'The horses your lordship sent for, with all the care
'Tis sweet at first t' acquire-after this process,
'Tis now the King's, and called Whitehall.
'Tis like a pardon after execution:
'Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take't of me-
'Tis his aspect of terror. All's not well.
'Tis well there's one above 'em yet. I had thought
'Tis my undoing. Love and meekness, lord,
'Twould fall upon ourselves.
'Tis ten to one this play can never please
'Tis too respective and too sociable
'Tis not the roundure of your old-fac'd walls  
'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,
'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
'Tis better that the enemy seek us;
'Tis three o'clock, and Romans, yet ere night
'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
'Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think,
'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
'To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.
'Tis from your sister.
'The fiend, the fiend'- he led me to that place.
'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord,
'Tis past, and so am I.- But what art thou
'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
'Tis won as towns with fire- so won, so lost.
'Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,  
'Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
'Thus must thou speak' and 'thus thy body bear,'
'Tu-who;
'Tu-who;
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
'Twixt this and supper. Go not my horse the better,
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
'Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;
'Tis hard to reconcile.
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
'Twixt you and your poor brother.
'Tis not the devil's crest.  
'Tis best that thou diest quickly.
'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
'Tis that he sent me of the Duke's return.
'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.
'Tis nine o'clock; our friends all stay for you;
'The fire seven times tried this;
'Tween snow and fire as treason and my love.
'Tween man and man; but thou, thou meagre lead,
'The slaves are ours.' So do I answer you:
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
'Twere good you do so much for charity.

'Tis like, my lord, you will not keep your hour.
'Tis that they seek; and they, in seeking that,
'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,
'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.
'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your Grace.
'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.
'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd,
'Twas men I lack'd, and you will give them me;
'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend;
'Tis but surmis'd whiles thou art standing by,
'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence;
'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,
'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
'Tis virtue that doth make them most admir'd;  
'Tis government that makes them seem divine;
'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,
'Tis not his new-made bride shall succour him;
'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong;
'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.
'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.
'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.
'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity.
'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better.
'Twas said they saw but one, and no discerner
'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake
'Twould prove the verity of certain words
'T has done, upon the premises, but justice.
'Tis full of woe; yet I can give you inkling
'The horses your lordship sent for, with all the care
'Tis sweet at first t' acquire-after this process,
'Tis now the King's, and called Whitehall.
'Tis like a pardon after execution:
'Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take't of me-
'Tis his aspect of terror. All's not well.
'Tis well there's one above 'em yet. I had thought
'Tis my undoing. Love and meekness, lord,
'Twould fall upon ourselves.
'Tis ten to one this play can never please
'Tis too respective and too sociable
'Tis not the roundure of your old-fac'd walls  
'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,
'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
'Tis better that the enemy seek us;
'Tis three o'clock, and Romans, yet ere night
'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
'Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think,
'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
'To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.
'Tis from your sister.
'The fiend, the fiend'- he led me to that place.
'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord,
'Tis past, and so am I.- But what art thou
'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
'Tis won as towns with fire- so won, so lost.
'Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,  
'Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
'Thus must thou speak' and 'thus thy body bear,'
'Tu-who;
'Tu-who;
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
'Twixt this and supper. Go not my horse the better,
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
'Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;
'Tis hard to reconcile.
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
'Twixt you and your poor brother.
'Tis not the devil's crest.  
'Tis best that thou diest quickly.
'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
'Tis that he sent me of the Duke's return.
'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.
'Tis nine o'clock; our friends all stay for you;
'The fire seven times tried this;
'Tween snow and fire as treason and my love.
'Tween man and man; but thou, thou meagre lead,
'The slaves are ours.' So do I answer you:
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
'Twere good you do so much for charity.
'Tis true. My name is Nym, and Falstaff loves your wife.
'Tis old but true: Still swine eats all the draff.      Exit
'The raging rocks
'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,
'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
'Tis certain so. The Prince wooes for himself.
'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.
'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.
'Tis oft with difference- yet do they all confirm
'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful.
'Twere now to be most happy; for I fear
'Tis pride that pulls the country down;
'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,
'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?
'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;
'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.
'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.
'Tis gone.
'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword; he dies.
'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.
'Twas I that kill'd her.  
'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.
'Tis in reversion that I do possess-
'Tis doubt he will be. Letters came last night  
'Tis very true: my grief lies all within;
'Tis nothing but some bond that he is ent'red into
'Tis full three months since I did see him last.
'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower;
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
'Tis time to speak-my pains are quite forgot.
'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.
'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
'Tis more than we deserve or I expect.
'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
'Thus saith the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferr'd'-
'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I
'This general applause and cheerful shout
'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest 'girdling one another
'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
'Tis not yet near day. Come, go with me;
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
'To seek him here that means not to be found.
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'
'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
'Tis now near night.
'Then music with her silver sound
'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well.  
'Tis hatch'd, and shall be so. Tranio, at once
'Twas told me you were rough, and coy, and sullen,
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
'Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both
'Tis in my head to do my master good:
'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom
'Tis marvel- but that you are but newly come,
'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here.
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
'Twere good he were school'd.
'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
'Tis true, my brother's daughter's Queen of Tunis;
'Twould put me to my slipper; but I feel not
'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,
'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,
'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;
'Tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;
'Twere sure enough.
'Tis necessary he should die:
'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect:
'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;
'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler
'Tis thou that rig'st the bark and plough'st the foam,
'Tis thou and those that have dishonoured me.
'Tis not the difference of a year or two
'Tis policy and stratagem must do
'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning,
'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.
'Tis not an hour since I left them there.
'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;
'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,
'To Saturn,' Caius- not to Saturnine:
'Tis he the common people love so much;
'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;
'Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus;  
'Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.
'Tis true, 'tis true: witness my knife's sharp point.
'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage-
'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquar'd,
'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,
'Tis dry enough-will with great speed of judgment,
'Twixt right and wrong; for pleasure and revenge
'Tis said he holds you well; and will be led
'Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss.
'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,
'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love
'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.
'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover.
'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.
'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,
'To her let us garlands bring.
'Tis pity love should be so contrary;
'Tis true; for Friar Lawrence met them both
'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.
'This is put forth too truly.' Besides, I have stay'd  
'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
'Tis none of mine.  
'Tis past enduring.
'Tis pity she's not honest- honourable.'
'Tis hop'd his sickness is discharg'd.
'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
'Tis rigour, and not law. Your honours all,
'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness- th' one
'Tis not a visitation fram'd, but forc'd
'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;
'Tis promised in the charity of age.
'That he did in the general bosom reign
'This said, his wat'ry eyes he did dismount,  
'That not a heart which in his level came
'Thus merely with the garment of a Grace  
'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.'
'Tis thee (my self) that for my self I praise,
'Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed,
'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,
'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept,
'Too young' and next year' and "Tis too early.'
'Twill be two days ere I shall see you; so
'Tis bitter.
'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;
'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
'Twere pregnant they should square between themselves;
'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour:
'Twixt these extremes at all.
'Tis sport to maul a runner.
'Tis well th'art gone,
'Tis the last service that I shall command you.
'This is no flattery; these are counsellors
'Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look
'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine;
'Twixt the souls of friend and friend;
'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well.  
'Tis I must make conclusion
'Tis Hymen peoples every town;
'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
'The pig' quoth I 'is burn'd'; 'My gold!' quoth he.
'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed
'Tis holy sport to be a little vain
'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.
'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he
'That I receive the general food at first
'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
'Tis south the city mills- bring me word thither
'Twere a perpetual spoil; and till we call'd  
'Tis warm at's heart.
'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise'; dismiss'd me
'This we receiv'd,' and each in either side
'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
'Twixt fair and foul?
'Twixt two such shes, would chatter this way and
'To th' tender of our present.
'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,
'Tis true- nay, keep the ring, 'tis true. I am sure
'Twixt hour and hour?
'Tis in my cloak-bag- doublet, hat, hose, all
'Tis time must do. Beseech your Majesty,
'Tis almost night; you shall have better cheer
'Tis the ninth hour o' th' morn.
'Twould move me sooner.
'Twas very Cloten.
'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,
'Tis he and Cloten; malice and lucre in them
'Two boys, an old man (twice a boy), a lane,
'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,  
'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.
'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it.
'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;
'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen
'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?
'Twixt amorous and villainous. Being thus quench'd
'Tis strange.
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'
'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:
'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
'Tis now the very witching time of night,
'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,  
'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
'Thus didest thou.'
'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
'Twas where the madcap Duke his uncle kept-
'Tis like the forc'd gait of a shuffling nag,
'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.
'Tis a point of friendship.
'Tis not ten years gone
'The time shall come'- thus did he follow it-
'The time will come that foul sin, gathering head,
'Tis needful that the most immodest word
'Tis merry in hall when beards wag an;
'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,  
'Tis a hooded valour, and when it appears it will bate.
'Tis not the balm, the sceptre, and the ball,
'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions, lords,
'Twas I, indeed, thou promised'st to strike,
'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.
'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
'Twas full of darnel-do you like the taste?
'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands;
'Tis but the short'ning of my life one day.
'Thou maiden youth, be vanquish'd by a maid.'
'Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt
'Twas neither Charles nor yet the Duke I nam'd,
'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,
'Tis known to you he is mine enemy;
'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.
'The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;
'Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?'
'Tis like, my lord, you will not keep your hour.
'Tis that they seek; and they, in seeking that,
'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,
'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.
'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your Grace.
'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.
'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd,
'Twas men I lack'd, and you will give them me;
'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend;
'Tis but surmis'd whiles thou art standing by,
'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence;
'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,
'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
'Tis virtue that doth make them most admir'd;  
'Tis government that makes them seem divine;
'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,
'Tis not his new-made bride shall succour him;
'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong;
'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.
'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.
'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.
'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity.
'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better.
'Twas said they saw but one, and no discerner
'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake

'Tis full of woe; yet I can give you inkling
'The horses your lordship sent for, with all the care

'Tis like a pardon after execution:
'Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take't of me-
'Tis his aspect of terror. All's not well.
'Tis well there's one above 'em yet. I had thought
'Tis my undoing. Love and meekness, lord,
'Twould fall upon ourselves.
'Tis ten to one this play can never please
'Tis too respective and too sociable
'Tis not the roundure of your old-fac'd walls

'The fiend, the fiend'- he led me to that place.
'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord,
'Tis past, and so am I.- But what art thou
'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
'Tis won as towns with fire- so won, so lost.
'Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,

'Thus must thou speak' and 'thus thy body bear,'

'Tis in my cloak-bag- doublet, hat, hose, all
'Tis time must do. Beseech your Majesty,
'Tis almost night; you shall have better cheer
'Tis the ninth hour o' th' morn.
'Twould move me sooner.
'Twas very Cloten.
'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,
'Tis he and Cloten; malice and lucre in them
'Two boys, an old man (twice a boy), a lane,
'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,  
'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.
'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it.
'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;
'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen
'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?
'Twixt amorous and villainous. Being thus quench'd
'Tis strange.
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
'That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth
'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
'The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast-'
'Tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:
'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
'Tis now the very witching time of night,
'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,  
'Tis heavy with him; and am I then reveng'd,
'Thus didest thou.'
'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
'Twas where the madcap Duke his uncle kept-
'Tis like the forc'd gait of a shuffling nag,
'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.
'Tis a point of friendship.
'Tis not ten years gone
'The time shall come'- thus did he follow it-
'The time will come that foul sin, gathering head,
'Tis needful that the most immodest word
'Tis merry in hall when beards wag an;
'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,  
'Tis a hooded valour, and when it appears it will bate.
'Tis not the balm, the sceptre, and the ball,
'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions, lords,
'Twas I, indeed, thou promised'st to strike,
'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.
'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
'Twas full of darnel-do you like the taste?
'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands;
'Tis but the short'ning of my life one day.
'Thou maiden youth, be vanquish'd by a maid.'
'Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt
'Twas neither Charles nor yet the Duke I nam'd,
'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,
'Tis known to you he is mine enemy;
'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.
'The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;
'Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?'
'Tis like, my lord, you will not keep your hour.
'Tis that they seek; and they, in seeking that,
'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,
'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.
'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your Grace.
'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.
'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd,
'Twas men I lack'd, and you will give them me;
'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend;
'Tis but surmis'd whiles thou art standing by,
'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence;
'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,
'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
'Tis virtue that doth make them most admir'd;  
'Tis government that makes them seem divine;
'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,
'Tis not his new-made bride shall succour him;
'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong;
'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.
'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.
'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.
'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity.
'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better.
'Twas said they saw but one, and no discerner
'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake
'Twould prove the verity of certain words
'T has done, upon the premises, but justice.
'Tis full of woe; yet I can give you inkling
'The horses your lordship sent for, with all the care
'Tis sweet at first t' acquire-after this process,
'Tis now the King's, and called Whitehall.
'Tis like a pardon after execution:
'Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take't of me-
'Tis his aspect of terror. All's not well.
'Tis well there's one above 'em yet. I had thought
'Tis my undoing. Love and meekness, lord,
'Twould fall upon ourselves.
'Tis ten to one this play can never please
'Tis too respective and too sociable
'Tis not the roundure of your old-fac'd walls  
'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,
'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
'Tis better that the enemy seek us;
'Tis three o'clock, and Romans, yet ere night
'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
'Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think,
'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
'To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.
'Tis from your sister.
'The fiend, the fiend'- he led me to that place.
'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord,
'Tis past, and so am I.- But what art thou
'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
'Tis won as towns with fire- so won, so lost.
'Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,  
'Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
'Thus must thou speak' and 'thus thy body bear,'
'Tu-who;
'Tu-who;
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
'Twixt this and supper. Go not my horse the better,
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
'Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;
'Tis hard to reconcile.
'Vive le roi!' as I have bank'd their towns?

A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted
A man in hue all hues in his controlling,
A dearer birth than this his love had brought
A loss in love that touches me more nearly.  
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,
A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
A third nor red, nor white, had stol'n of both,
A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
A god in love, to whom I am confined.
A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe,
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face,
A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
A dateless lively heat still to endure,
A PAGE, Servant to the Countess of Rousillon
A WIDOW OF FLORENCE.
A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,
A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,
A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;  
A braving war.
A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
A native slip to us from foreign seeds.
A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
A senseless help, when help past sense we deem.
A modest one to bear me back again.
A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame,
A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
A poor physician's daughter-thou dislik'st
A lying trophy; and as oft is dumb
A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
A balance more replete.
A young man married is a man that's marr'd.
A very serious business calls on him.
A charge too heavy for my strength; but yet
A lover of thy drum, hater of love.                   Exeunt
A tucket afar off. Enter an old WIDOW OF FLORENCE, her daughter DIANA,
A shrewd turn, if she pleas'd.
A wife of me, though there my hope be done.
A stranger, no offender; and inform him
A SOOTHSAYER
A CLOWN
A little I can read.
A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
A man who is the abstract of all faults
A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
A space for farther travel.
A better ear. Menas, I did not think
A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense  
A blessed lottery to him.
A meaner than myself; since I myself
A cistern for scal'd snakes! Go, get thee hence.
A sennet sounded. Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS,
A plain in Syria
A statue than a breather.
A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented
A soldier and his horse.
A plain near Actium
A most unnoble swerving.
A private man in Athens. This for him.
A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
A diminution in our captain's brain
A mangled shadow. Perchance to-morrow
A workman in't.
A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
A shrewd one to's.
A master-leaver and a fugitive!
A hill near Alexandria
A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
A forked mountain, or blue promontory
A million moe, now lost- she, Eros, has
A nobleness in record. But I will be
A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
A greater crack. The round world
A moiety of the world.
A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar:
A minister of her will; and it is great
A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly
A sun and moon, which kept their course and lighted
A benefit in this change; but if you seek
A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
A pair so famous. High events as these
A person representing HYMEN
A lawn before the DUKE'S palace
A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
A boar spear in my hand; and- in my heart
A thievish living on the common road?
A stubborn will to please,
A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and LORDS, like outlaws
A motley fool. A miserable world!  
A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
A scatt'red smile, and that I'll live upon.
A little riper and more lusty red
A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,
A sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?
A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,
A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
A COURTEZAN
A hall in the DUKE'S palace
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
A mean woman was delivered
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
A man is master of his liberty;
A wretched soul, bruis'd with adversity,
A sunny look of his would soon repair.
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish.
A vulgar comment will be made of it,
A husband's office? Shall, Antipholus,
A public place
A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;
A wolf, nay worse, a fellow all in buff;
A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands
A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dry-foot well;
A chain, a chain. Do you not hear it ring?
A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
A nut, a cherry-stone;
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
A street
A street before a priory
A sin prevailing much in youthful men
A charitable duty of my order;
A most outrageous fit of madness took him,
A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,
A needy, hollow-ey'd, sharp-looking wretch,
A living dead man. This pernicious slave,
A ROMAN HERALD
A CITIZEN of Antium  
A pretty tale. It may be you have heard it;
A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
A place below the first; for what miscarries
A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
A field of battle between the Roman and the Volscian camps
A bribe to pay my sword. I do refuse it,
A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius, Marcius!'
A flourish. Cornets. Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS bloody, with two or three soldiers
A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the
A curse begin at very root on's heart
A sure destruction.
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
A sennet. Enter the PATRICIANS and the TRIBUNES
A little of that worthy work perform'd
A kinder value of the people than
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
A place of potency and sway o' th' state,
A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labour'd,
A man of their infirmity.
A noble life before a long, and wish
A foe to th' public weal. Obey, I charge thee,
A brand to th' end o' th' world.
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't;
A most inherent baseness.
A noble cunning. You were us'd to load me
A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
A highway between Rome and Antium
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
A worthy officer i' the war, but insolent,
A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
A camp at a short distance from Rome
A noble servant to them, but he could not
A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
A pair of tribunes that have wrack'd for Rome
A private whisper- no, not with such friends
A mother less, or granted less, Aufidius?
A better witness back than words, which we,
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
A city full; of tribunes such as you,
A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
A good construction. I rais'd him, and I pawn'd
A twist of rotten silk; never admitting
A FRENCH GENTLEMAN, friend to Philario
A ROMAN CAPTAIN
A sample to the youngest; to th' more mature
A glass that feated them; and to the graver
A child that guided dotards. To his mistress,
A year's age on me!
A seat for baseness.
A lustre to it.
A man worth any woman; overbuys me
A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
A drop of blood a day and, being aged,
A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect
A sly and constant knave,
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady
A Gallian girl at home. He furnaces
A saucy stranger in his court to mart  
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer  
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,
A pantler- not so eminent!
A second night of such sweet shortness which  
A pudency so rosy, the sweet view on't
A world by itself, and we will nothing pay
A riding suit, no costlier than would fit
A franklin's huswife.
A cell of ignorance, travelling abed,
A prison for a debtor that not dares
A pain that only seems to seek out danger
A storm, or robbery, call it what you will,
A look untender! If't be summer news,
A little witness my obedience. Look!
A strain of rareness; and I grieve myself
A man already.
A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.
A conduct overland to Milford Haven.
A thing more made of malice than of duty;
A dram of worth be drawn.
A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,
A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
A law-breaker, a villain. Yield thee, thief.
A headless man? The garments of Posthumus?
A very valiant Briton and a good,
A grave. Come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd
A fever with the absence of her son;
A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,
A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel
A very drudge of nature's, have subdu'd me
A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,  
A stop i' th' chaser, a retire; anon
A rout, confusion thick. Forthwith they fly,
A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.
A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again
A thing of pity.
A father to me; and thou hast created
A mother and two brothers. But, O scorn,
A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer.
A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,
A shop of all the qualities that man
A sacrilegious thief, to do't. The temple
A precious thing! I had it from the Queen.
A certain stuff, which, being ta'en would cease
A banish'd traitor.
A pair of worthier sons.
A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother
A Roman and a British ensign wave
A Gentleman, courtier.
A Priest.
A Norwegian Captain.
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
A sable silver'd.
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
A double blessing is a double grace;
A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-  
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
A scullion!  
A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
A second time I kill my husband dead
A very, very- pajock.
A room in the Castle.
A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
A villain kills my father; and for that,
A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
A station like the herald Mercury
A combination and a form indeed
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
A noise within.
A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
A face without a heart,'
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
A very noble youth. Mark.
A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
A table and flagons of wine on it.  
A post from Wales, loaden with heavy news;
A thousand of his people butchered;
A gallant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not?
A son who is the theme of honour's tongue,
A pouncet box, which ever and anon
A plague upon it! it is in GIoucestershire-  
A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed,
A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
A gross fat man.
A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.
A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
A virtue that was never seen in you.
A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,
A couching lion and a ramping cat,
A good mouth-filling oath; and leave 'in sooth'
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
A mighty and a fearful head they are,
A comfort of retirement lives in this.
A larger dare to our great enterprise,
A public road near Coventry.
A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
A prodigy of fear, and a portent
A hare-brained Hotspur govern'd by a spleen.
A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,
A sword whose temper I intend to stain
A second time do such a courtesy.
A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;
A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear:
A very valiant rebel of the name.  
A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
A retreat is sounded.
A noble earl, and many a creature else
A gentleman well bred and of good name,
A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,
A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,
A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
A naked subject to the weeping clouds
A dozen captains stay at door for you.
A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?  
A certain instance that Glendower is dead.
A rotten case abides no handling.
A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,
A ragged and forestall'd remission.
A cup of wine, sir?
A cup of wine that's brisk and fine,
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,
A hundred alms-houses right well supplied;
A thousand pounds by th' year: thus runs the bill.
A fearful battle rend'red you in music.
A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'
A little cloth.
A night is but small breath and little pause
A city on th' inconstant billows dancing;
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,
A damned death!
A largess universal, like the sun,
A little touch of Harry in the night.
A good soft pillow for that good white head  
A lad of life, an imp of fame;
A very little little let us do,
A many of our bodies shall no doubt
A testament of noble-ending love.
A LAWYER
A FRENCH SERGEANT
A PORTER
A far more glorious star thy soul will make
A third thinks, without expense at all,
A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,
A holy maid hither with me I bring,
A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have plac'd;
A holy prophetess new risen up,
A woman clad in armour chaseth them.
A witch by fear, not force, like Hannibal,
A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear
A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd;
A second Hector, for his grim aspect
A thousand souls to death and deadly night.
A man of thy profession and degree;
A prophet to the fall of all our foes!
A braver soldier never couched lance,
A gentler heart did never sway in court;
A stouter champion never handled sword.
A letter was deliver'd to my hands,
A little herd of England's timorous deer,
A terrible and unavoided danger;
A field of battle
A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.
A man of great authority in France,
A goodly prize, fit for the devil's grace!
A virgin, and his servant, say to him.
A virgin from her tender infancy,
A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
A LIEUTENANT, a SHIPMASTER, a MASTER'S MATE, and WALTER WHITMORE  
A SPIRIT raised by him
A world of earthly blessings to my soul,
A day will come when York shall claim his own;
A spirit rais'd from depth of underground
A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!
A sorry breakfast for my Lord Protector.
A man that ne'er saw in his life before.
A hundred times and oft'ner, in my sleep,
A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,
A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.
A heart it was, bound in with diamonds-
A wilderness is populous enough,
A cunning man did calculate my birth  
A Roman sworder and banditto slave
A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul
A poor esquire of Kent that loves his king.
A NOBLEMAN                         TWO KEEPERS
A HUNTSMAN
A SON that has killed his father
A FATHER that has killed his son
A woman's general; what should we fear?  
A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'  
A bird that will revenge upon you all;
A crown for York!-and, lords, bow low to him.
A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire
A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day
A field of battle between Towton and Saxton, in Yorkshire
A loud alarum. Enter CLIFFORD, wounded
A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.
A chase in the north of England
A man at least, for less I should not be;
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
A cold premeditation for my purpose!
A plain in Warwickshire
A park near Middleham Castle in Yorkshire
A salve for any sore that may betide.
A parley, sirrah, to George of Clarence.
A field of battle near Barnet
A CRIER
A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
A man may weep upon his wedding-day.
A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys  
A place next to the King.
A new hell in himself.
A most poor issue?
A thing inspir'd, and, not consulting, broke
A minister in his power. You know his nature,
A full hot horse, who being allow'd his way,
A noise within, crying 'Room for the Queen!'
A single voice; and that not pass'd me but
A trembling contribution! Why, we take  
A fit or two o' th' face; but they are shrewd ones;
A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.
A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong  
A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;
A good digestion to you all; and once more
A noble company! What are their pleasures?
A thousand thanks, and pray 'em take their pleasures.
A little happier than my wretched father;
A most unnatural and faithless service.
A strong faith to conceal it.
A buzzing of a separation
A woman of less place might ask by law-
A thousand pound a year, annual support,
A very fresh-fish here-fie, fie, fie upon
A thousand pounds a year for pure respect!  
A prince most prudent, of an excellent
A year before. It is not to be question'd  
A better wife, let him in nought be trusted
A royal lady, spake one the least word that might
A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and
A strange tongue makes my cause more strange, suspicious;
A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?
A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,
A soul as even as a calm. Pray think us
A creature of the Queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'
A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain
A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to
A loyal and obedient subject is
A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune,
A league between his Highness and Ferrara.
A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,
A peace above all earthly dignities,
A still and quiet conscience. The King has cur'd me,
A load would sink a navy-too much honour.
A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.
A street in Westminster
A distance from her, while her Grace sat down
A man in much esteem with th' King, and truly
A worthy friend. The King has made him Master
A gentleman, sent from the King, to see you.
A right good husband, let him be a noble;
A queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.
A most arch heretic, a pestilence  
A quiet night, and my good mistress will  
A man of his place, and so near our favour,
A Council table brought in, with chairs and stools, and placed
A man that more detests, more stirs against,
A shrewd turn and he's your friend for ever.'
A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.
A pattern to all princes living with her,
A most unspotted lily shall she pass
A soldier by the honour-giving hand
A half-fac'd groat five hundred pound a year!
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
A foot of honour better than I was;
A will that bars the title of thy son.
A woman's will; a cank'red grandam's will!
A peaceful progress to the ocean.
A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,
A widow, husbandless, subject to fears;
A woman, naturally born to fears;
A widow cries: Be husband to me, heavens!
A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear
A mother's curse-on her revolting son.
A chafed lion by the mortal paw,
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
A rage whose heat hath this condition
A passion hateful to my purposes;
A whole armado of convicted sail
A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,
A fearful eye thou hast; where is that blood
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
A thousand businesses are brief in hand,  
A cock'red silken wanton, brave our fields
A voluntary zeal and an unurg'd faith
A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
A Soothsayer
A Poet
A public place.
A wretched creature and must bend his body
A man of such a feeble temper should
A street. Thunder and lightning.
A man no mightier than thyself or me
A shrewd contriver; and you know his means,
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.
A woman well reputed, Cato's daughter.
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
A street near the Capitol.
A crowd of people, among them Artemidorus and the Soothsayer.
A Hail, Caesar! Read this schedule.
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
A street.
A house in Rome. Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus, seated at a table.
A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds
A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,
A little from this ground.
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
A canopy most fatal, under which
A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend.
A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe,
A Captain under Edmund's command.
A Herald.
A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
A credulous father! and a brother noble,
A little to disquantity your train,
A babe to honour her! If she must teem,  
A fox when one has caught her,
A court within the Castle of the Earl of Gloucester.
A childlike office.
A plague upon your epileptic visage!  
A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
A good man's fortune may grow out at heels.
A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle  
A heath.
A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.
A farmhouse near Gloucester's Castle.
A mistress's command. Wear this.          [Gives a favour.]
A father, and a gracious aged man,
A man, a prince, by him so benefited!  
A woman's shape doth shield thee.
A troop of horse with felt. I'll put't in proof,  
A plot upon her virtuous husband's life,
A drum afar off.
A tent in the French camp.
A field between the two camps.
A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'no,'
A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.
A FORESTER
A mild of grace and complete majesty-
A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
A man of complements, whom right and wrong
A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.
A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red.
A man of sovereign parts, peerless esteem'd,
A hundred thousand more, in surety of the which,
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast,
A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
A domineering pedant o'er the boy,
A woman, that is like a German clock,
A whitely wanton with a velvet brow,
A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.
A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
A green goose a goddess- pure, pure idolatry.
A caudle, ho!
A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,  
A leg, a limb-
A true man or a thief that gallops so?
A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
A wife of such wood were felicity.
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind.
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
A huge translation of hypocrisy,
A better speech was never spoke before.
A mean most meanly; and in ushering,
A world of torments though I should endure,
A mess of Russians left us but of late.
A man so breathed that certain he would fight ye,
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue.
A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,
A wife?
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
A Scottish Doctor
A Sergeant
A Porter
A desert place. Thunder and lightning.
A camp near Forres. Alarum within.
A heath. Thunder.
A prosperous gentleman; and to be King  
A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
A limbeck only. When in swinish sleep
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
A bell rings.
A little water clears us of this deed.
A fellow to it.
A falcon towering in her pride of place
A deed of dreadful note.
A park near the palace.
A Hall in the palace. A banquet prepared.
A woman's story at a winter's fire,
A heath. Thunder.
A cavern. In the middle, a boiling cauldron. Thunder.
A show of eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand;
A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
A stanchless avarice that, were I King,
A most miraculous work in this good King,
A modern ecstasy. The dead man's knell
A cry of women within.
A JUSTICE
A pow'r I have, but of what strength and nature
A street
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
A monastery
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
A nunnery
A novice of this place, and the fair sister
A warrant for his execution.
A hall in ANGELO'S house
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
A prison
A man already made, as to remit
A merriment than a vice.
A pond as deep as hell.
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
A word of this. What ho, within! come forth.  
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
A league below the city; and from thence,
A street near the city gate
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then  
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
A very scurvy fellow.  
A marble monument!
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds
A stage, where every man must play a part,
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
A breed for barren metal of his friend?-
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.                  Exit
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
A coin that bears the figure of an angel  
A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
A vessel of our country richly fraught.
A young Venetian, one that comes before
A day in April never came so sweet
A SONG
A golden mesh t' entrap the hearts of men
A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich,
A creature that did bear the shape of man
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
A many fools that stand in better place,
A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
A losing suit against him. Are you answered?
A messenger with letters from the doctor,
A young and learned doctor to our court.
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
A substitute shines brightly as a king
A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy
A prating boy that begg'd it as a fee;
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
A room in the Garter Inn
A field near Windsor
A field near Frogmore
A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.
A street leading to the Park
A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
A wood near Athens
A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king.
A merrier hour was never wasted there.
A sweet Athenian lady is in love
A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
A million fail, confounding oath on oath.
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.
A weak bond holds you; I'll not trust your word.
A local habitation and a name.
A lion fell, nor else no lion's dam;
A fortnight hold we this solemnity,
A Sexton.
A Boy.
A room in Leonato's house.
A hall in Leonato's house.
A hall in Leonato's house.
A room in Leonato's house.
A street.
A Room in Leonato's house.
A church.
A thousand times in secret.
A thousand blushing apparitions
A sin of perjury: she not denies it.
A prison.
A third is fled--that had a hand in it.
A churchyard.
A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
A Clown in service to Othello
A council chamber. The Duke and Senators sitting at a table;
A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.
A natural and prompt alacrity
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
A man he is of honesty and trust.  
A seaport in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.
A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements.
A Veronesa. Michael Cassio,
A cry within, "A sail, a sail, a sail!"
A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
A cry within, "A sail, a sail!" Guns heard.
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,
A street.
A hall in the castle.
A soldier's a man;
A cry within, "Help, help!"
A bell rings.
A Florentine more kind and honest.
A room in the castle.
A man that languishes in your displeasure.
A stranger to thy thoughts.
A sequester from liberty, fasting, and prayer,
A frank one.
A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
A passion most unsuiting such a man-
A housewife that by selling her desires
A room in the castle.
A closet lock and key of villainous secrets.
A drop of patience; but, alas, to make me
A fixed figure for the time of scorn
A bedchamber in the castle. Desdemona in bed asleep; a light burning.
A murther, which I thought a sacrifice.
A thousand times committed. Cassio confess'd it,
A better never did itself sustain
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;
A recreant and most degenerate traitor;
A jewel in a ten-times barr'd-up chest
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
A traitor to my God, my King, and me.
A loyal, just, and upright gentleman.  
A traitor to his God, his King, and him;
A long flourish, while the KING consults his Council
A dearer merit, not so deep a maim
A partial slander sought I to avoid,
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,
A parasite, a keeper-back of death,
A banish'd traitor. All my treasury
A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
A camp in Wales
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
A glorious angel. Then, if angels fight,
A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.
A little little grave, an obscure grave-
A brittle glory shineth in this face;
A plot shall show us all a merry day.                 Exeunt
A twofold marriage-'twixt my crown and me,
A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.
A beggar begs that never begg'd before.
A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
A YOUNG SON OF CLARENCE (Edward, Earl of Warwick)
A YOUNG DAUGHTER OF CLARENCE (Margaret Plantagenet,
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman-
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
A plague upon you all! His royal Grace-
A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too.
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
A liberal rewarder of his friends;
A husband and a son thou ow'st to me;
A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon,
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
A begging prince what beggar pities not?
A sennet.
A knot you are of damned blood-suckers.
A care-craz'd mother to a many sons,
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
A happy and a joyful time of day!
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
A king!-perhaps-
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
A dire induction am I witness to,
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death.
A mother only mock'd with two fair babes,
A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag
A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble,
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
A grievous burden was thy birth to me;
A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave
A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
A grandam's name is little less in love
A royal battle might be won and lost.
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
A base foul stone, made precious by the foil
A black day will it be to somebody.
A thing devised by the enemy.
A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
A scum of Britaines, and base lackey peasants,
A milk-sop, one that never in his life  
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!             Exeunt  
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.  
A Street.
A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;
A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.
A street.
A visor for a visor! What care I
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
A villain, that is hither come in spite
A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
A street.
A lover may bestride the gossamer
A public place.
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
A gentleman of princely parentage,
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.  
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
A precious ring- a ring that I must use
A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
A lightning before death. O, how may I
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
A greater power than we can contradict
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
A LORD
A PEDANT
A WIDOW
A most delicious banquet by his bed,
A bedchamber in the LORD'S house
A flourish of trumpets announces the play
A course of learning and ingenious studies.
A merchant of great traffic through the world,
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
A man well known throughout all Italy.
A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack,
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
A horse and a man
A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
A merchant of incomparable wealth.
A velvet dish. Fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy;
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap.
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie;
A public road
A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled-
A ship at sea; afterwards an uninhabited island
A time before we came unto this cell?
A prince of power.
A falsehood, in its contrary as great
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
A treacherous army levied, one midnight
A mark so bloody on the business; but
A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg'd,
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
A most auspicious star, whose influence
A dozen years; within which space she died,
A freckl'd whelp, hag-born-not honour'd with
A human shape.
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows,
A thing divine; for nothing natural
A matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,  
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king-
A contract of true love; be not too late.  
A noise of hunters beard. Enter divers SPIRITS, in
A solemn air, and the best comforter
A hearty welcome.
A vision of the island, one dear son
A heaviness that's gone.

A SENATOR'S house
A visage of demand; for I do fear,
A thousand talents to me.
A public place
A hall in TIMON'S house
A moderate table.
A banqueting hall in TIMON'S house
A dedicated beggar to the air,
A pox of wrinkles!
A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'st
A stone by thee.                     [Throws a stone at him]
A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal
A CAPTAIN
A MESSENGER
A CLOWN
A NURSE, and a black CHILD
A special party, have by common voice
A nobler man, a braver warrior,
A mother's tears in passion for her son;
A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;
A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.
A father and a friend to thee and Rome.
A Roman now adopted happily,
A speedier course than ling'ring languishment
A forest near Rome
A lonely part of the forest
A very excellent piece of villainy.
A barren detested vale you see it is:
A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
A very fatal place it seems to me.
A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints;
A precious ring that lightens all this hole,
A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
A stone is soft as wax: tribunes more hard than stones.
A stone is silent and offendeth not,
A banquet.
A deed of death done on the innocent
A joyful issue.
A long-tongu'd babbling gossip? No, lords, no.
A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?
A halter, soldiers! Hang him on this tree,
A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam.
A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant  
A ROMAN. You sad Andronici, have done with woes;
A Prologue arm'd, but not in confidence
A lord of Troyan blood, nephew to Hector;
A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
A stranger to those most imperial looks
A prince called Hector-Priam is his father-
A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
A form of strangeness as we pass along.  
A very horse that has he knows not what!  
A great-siz'd monster of ingratitudes.
A woman impudent and mannish grown
A labour sav'd!
A thousand complete courses of the sun!
A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple  
A Troyan hath been slain; since she could speak,
A priest, there off'ring to it his own heart.                Exit
A victor shall be known? Will you the knights
A little proudly, and great deal misprizing
A second hope as fairly built as Hector.
A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;
A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
A great addition earned in thy death.
A thought of added honour torn from Hector.
A drop of Grecian blood. The end crowns all;
A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?
A token from her daughter, my fair love,
A guard of patience. Stay a little while.
A SEA CAPTAIN, friend of Viola
A city in Illyria; and the sea-coast near it
A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh  
A gracious person; but yet I cannot love him.

A murd'rous guilt shows not itself more soon

A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.           Exit
A baubling vessel was he captain of,
A natural perspective, that is and is not.

A most extracting frenzy of mine own
A solemn combination shall be made
A foolish thing was but a toy,
A great while ago the world begun,
A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had buried her grandam;
A journey to my loving Proteus.
A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears,
A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,
A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears;
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,
A man I am cross'd with adversity;
A linguist, and a man of such perfection
A slave that still an end turns me to shame!  
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful!
A smaller boon than this I cannot beg,
A MARINER
A GAOLER
A servant grafted in my serious trust,
A lip of much contempt, speeds from me;
A party in this alteration, finding
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril  
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
A federary with her, and one that knows
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
A school-boy's top. Away with her to prison.
A thriving issue; there is no lady living
A man, the worst about you.
A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door!
A most intelligencing bawd!
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence,
A just and open trial. While she lives,
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
A moiety of the throne, a great king's daughter,
A lady like me; with a love even such,
A lullaby too rough; I never saw
A merry heart goes all the day,
A ram and bleated; and the fire-rob'd god,
A way to make us better friends, more known.
A fair one are you- well you fit our ages
A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
A wave o' th' sea, that you might ever do
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepar'd
A place whereto you'll go?
A great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking on's teeth.
A saint-like sorrow. No fault could you make
A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
A graceful gentleman, against whose person,
A shepherd's daughter.
A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far-
A LOVER'S COMPLAINT
A plaintful story from a sist'ring vale,
A thousand favours from a maund she drew  
A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh,
A youthful suit- it was to gain my grace-
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted
A man in hue all hues in his controlling,
A dearer birth than this his love had brought
A loss in love that touches me more nearly.  
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,
A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
A third nor red, nor white, had stol'n of both,
A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
A god in love, to whom I am confined.
A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe,
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face,
A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
A dateless lively heat still to endure,

A native slip to us from foreign seeds.

A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
A senseless help, when help past sense we deem.
A modest one to bear me back again.
A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame,
A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
A poor physician's daughter-thou dislik'st
A lying trophy; and as oft is dumb
A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
A balance more replete.
A young man married is a man that's marr'd.
A very serious business calls on him.
A charge too heavy for my strength; but yet

A CLOWN
A little I can read.
A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
A man who is the abstract of all faults
A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
A space for farther travel.
A better ear. Menas, I did not think
A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense  
A blessed lottery to him.
A meaner than myself; since I myself
A cistern for scal'd snakes! Go, get thee hence.
A sennet sounded. Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS,

A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
A greater crack. The round world

A minister of her will; and it is great
A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly

A lawn before the DUKE'S palace
A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
A boar spear in my hand; and- in my heart
A thievish living on the common road?
A stubborn will to please,
A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and LORDS, like outlaws
A motley fool. A miserable world!  
A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
A scatt'red smile, and that I'll live upon.
A little riper and more lusty red
A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,
A sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?
A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,
A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
A COURTEZAN
A hall in the DUKE'S palace
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
A mean woman was delivered
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
A man is master of his liberty;
A wretched soul, bruis'd with adversity,
A sunny look of his would soon repair.
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish.
A vulgar comment will be made of it,
A husband's office? Shall, Antipholus,
A public place
A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;
A wolf, nay worse, a fellow all in buff;
A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands
A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dry-foot well;
A chain, a chain. Do you not hear it ring?
A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
A nut, a cherry-stone;
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
A street
A street before a priory
A sin prevailing much in youthful men
A charitable duty of my order;
A most outrageous fit of madness took him,
A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,
A needy, hollow-ey'd, sharp-looking wretch,
A living dead man. This pernicious slave,
A ROMAN HERALD
A CITIZEN of Antium  
A pretty tale. It may be you have heard it;
A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
A place below the first; for what miscarries
A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
A field of battle between the Roman and the Volscian camps
A bribe to pay my sword. I do refuse it,
A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius, Marcius!'
A flourish. Cornets. Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS bloody, with two or three soldiers
A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the
A curse begin at very root on's heart
A sure destruction.
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
A sennet. Enter the PATRICIANS and the TRIBUNES
A little of that worthy work perform'd
A kinder value of the people than
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
A place of potency and sway o' th' state,
A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labour'd,
A man of their infirmity.
A noble life before a long, and wish
A foe to th' public weal. Obey, I charge thee,
A brand to th' end o' th' world.
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't;
A most inherent baseness.
A noble cunning. You were us'd to load me
A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
A highway between Rome and Antium
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
A worthy officer i' the war, but insolent,
A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
A camp at a short distance from Rome
A noble servant to them, but he could not
A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
A pair of tribunes that have wrack'd for Rome
A private whisper- no, not with such friends
A mother less, or granted less, Aufidius?
A better witness back than words, which we,
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
A city full; of tribunes such as you,
A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
A good construction. I rais'd him, and I pawn'd
A twist of rotten silk; never admitting
A FRENCH GENTLEMAN, friend to Philario
A ROMAN CAPTAIN
A sample to the youngest; to th' more mature
A glass that feated them; and to the graver
A child that guided dotards. To his mistress,
A year's age on me!
A seat for baseness.
A lustre to it.
A man worth any woman; overbuys me
A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
A drop of blood a day and, being aged,
A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect
A sly and constant knave,
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady
A Gallian girl at home. He furnaces
A saucy stranger in his court to mart  
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer  
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,
A pantler- not so eminent!
A second night of such sweet shortness which  
A pudency so rosy, the sweet view on't
A world by itself, and we will nothing pay
A riding suit, no costlier than would fit
A franklin's huswife.
A cell of ignorance, travelling abed,
A prison for a debtor that not dares
A pain that only seems to seek out danger
A storm, or robbery, call it what you will,
A look untender! If't be summer news,
A little witness my obedience. Look!
A strain of rareness; and I grieve myself
A man already.
A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.
A conduct overland to Milford Haven.
A thing more made of malice than of duty;
A dram of worth be drawn.
A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,
A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
A law-breaker, a villain. Yield thee, thief.
A headless man? The garments of Posthumus?
A very valiant Briton and a good,
A grave. Come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd
A fever with the absence of her son;
A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,
A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel
A very drudge of nature's, have subdu'd me
A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,  
A stop i' th' chaser, a retire; anon
A rout, confusion thick. Forthwith they fly,
A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.
A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again
A thing of pity.
A father to me; and thou hast created
A mother and two brothers. But, O scorn,
A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer.
A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,
A shop of all the qualities that man
A sacrilegious thief, to do't. The temple
A precious thing! I had it from the Queen.
A certain stuff, which, being ta'en would cease
A banish'd traitor.
A pair of worthier sons.
A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother
A Roman and a British ensign wave
A Gentleman, courtier.
A Priest.
A Norwegian Captain.
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
A sable silver'd.
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
A double blessing is a double grace;
A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-  
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
A scullion!  
A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
A second time I kill my husband dead
A very, very- pajock.
A room in the Castle.
A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
A villain kills my father; and for that,
A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
A station like the herald Mercury
A combination and a form indeed
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
A noise within.
A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
A face without a heart,'
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
A very noble youth. Mark.
A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
A table and flagons of wine on it.  
A post from Wales, loaden with heavy news;
A thousand of his people butchered;
A gallant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not?
A son who is the theme of honour's tongue,
A pouncet box, which ever and anon
A plague upon it! it is in GIoucestershire-  
A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed,
A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
A gross fat man.
A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.
A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
A virtue that was never seen in you.
A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,
A couching lion and a ramping cat,
A good mouth-filling oath; and leave 'in sooth'
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
A mighty and a fearful head they are,
A comfort of retirement lives in this.
A larger dare to our great enterprise,
A public road near Coventry.
A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
A prodigy of fear, and a portent
A hare-brained Hotspur govern'd by a spleen.
A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,
A sword whose temper I intend to stain
A second time do such a courtesy.
A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;
A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear:
A very valiant rebel of the name.  
A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
A retreat is sounded.
A noble earl, and many a creature else
A gentleman well bred and of good name,
A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,
A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,
A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
A naked subject to the weeping clouds
A dozen captains stay at door for you.
A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?  
A certain instance that Glendower is dead.
A rotten case abides no handling.
A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,
A ragged and forestall'd remission.
A cup of wine, sir?
A cup of wine that's brisk and fine,
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,
A hundred alms-houses right well supplied;
A thousand pounds by th' year: thus runs the bill.
A fearful battle rend'red you in music.
A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'
A little cloth.
A night is but small breath and little pause
A city on th' inconstant billows dancing;
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,
A damned death!
A largess universal, like the sun,
A little touch of Harry in the night.
A good soft pillow for that good white head  
A lad of life, an imp of fame;
A very little little let us do,
A many of our bodies shall no doubt
A testament of noble-ending love.
A LAWYER
A FRENCH SERGEANT
A PORTER
A far more glorious star thy soul will make
A third thinks, without expense at all,
A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,
A holy maid hither with me I bring,
A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have plac'd;
A holy prophetess new risen up,
A woman clad in armour chaseth them.
A witch by fear, not force, like Hannibal,
A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear
A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd;
A second Hector, for his grim aspect
A thousand souls to death and deadly night.
A man of thy profession and degree;
A prophet to the fall of all our foes!
A braver soldier never couched lance,
A gentler heart did never sway in court;
A stouter champion never handled sword.
A letter was deliver'd to my hands,
A little herd of England's timorous deer,
A terrible and unavoided danger;
A field of battle
A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.
A man of great authority in France,
A goodly prize, fit for the devil's grace!
A virgin, and his servant, say to him.
A virgin from her tender infancy,
A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
A LIEUTENANT, a SHIPMASTER, a MASTER'S MATE, and WALTER WHITMORE  
A SPIRIT raised by him
A world of earthly blessings to my soul,
A day will come when York shall claim his own;
A spirit rais'd from depth of underground
A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!
A sorry breakfast for my Lord Protector.
A man that ne'er saw in his life before.
A hundred times and oft'ner, in my sleep,
A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,
A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.
A heart it was, bound in with diamonds-
A wilderness is populous enough,
A cunning man did calculate my birth  
A Roman sworder and banditto slave
A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul
A poor esquire of Kent that loves his king.
A NOBLEMAN                         TWO KEEPERS
A HUNTSMAN
A SON that has killed his father
A FATHER that has killed his son
A woman's general; what should we fear?  
A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'  
A bird that will revenge upon you all;
A crown for York!-and, lords, bow low to him.
A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire
A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day
A field of battle between Towton and Saxton, in Yorkshire
A loud alarum. Enter CLIFFORD, wounded
A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.
A chase in the north of England
A man at least, for less I should not be;
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
A cold premeditation for my purpose!
A plain in Warwickshire
A park near Middleham Castle in Yorkshire
A salve for any sore that may betide.
A parley, sirrah, to George of Clarence.
A field of battle near Barnet
A CRIER
A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
A man may weep upon his wedding-day.
A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys  
A place next to the King.
A new hell in himself.
A most poor issue?
A thing inspir'd, and, not consulting, broke
A minister in his power. You know his nature,
A full hot horse, who being allow'd his way,
A noise within, crying 'Room for the Queen!'
A single voice; and that not pass'd me but
A trembling contribution! Why, we take  
A fit or two o' th' face; but they are shrewd ones;
A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.
A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong  
A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;
A good digestion to you all; and once more
A noble company! What are their pleasures?
A thousand thanks, and pray 'em take their pleasures.
A little happier than my wretched father;
A most unnatural and faithless service.
A strong faith to conceal it.
A buzzing of a separation
A woman of less place might ask by law-
A thousand pound a year, annual support,
A very fresh-fish here-fie, fie, fie upon
A thousand pounds a year for pure respect!  
A prince most prudent, of an excellent
A year before. It is not to be question'd  
A better wife, let him in nought be trusted
A royal lady, spake one the least word that might
A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and
A strange tongue makes my cause more strange, suspicious;
A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?
A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,
A soul as even as a calm. Pray think us
A creature of the Queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'
A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain
A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to
A loyal and obedient subject is
A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune,
A league between his Highness and Ferrara.
A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,
A peace above all earthly dignities,
A still and quiet conscience. The King has cur'd me,
A load would sink a navy-too much honour.
A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.
A street in Westminster
A distance from her, while her Grace sat down
A man in much esteem with th' King, and truly
A worthy friend. The King has made him Master
A gentleman, sent from the King, to see you.
A right good husband, let him be a noble;
A queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.
A most arch heretic, a pestilence  
A quiet night, and my good mistress will  
A man of his place, and so near our favour,
A Council table brought in, with chairs and stools, and placed
A man that more detests, more stirs against,
A shrewd turn and he's your friend for ever.'
A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.
A pattern to all princes living with her,
A most unspotted lily shall she pass
A soldier by the honour-giving hand
A half-fac'd groat five hundred pound a year!
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
A foot of honour better than I was;
A will that bars the title of thy son.
A woman's will; a cank'red grandam's will!
A peaceful progress to the ocean.
A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,
A widow, husbandless, subject to fears;
A woman, naturally born to fears;
A widow cries: Be husband to me, heavens!
A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear
A mother's curse-on her revolting son.
A chafed lion by the mortal paw,
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
A rage whose heat hath this condition
A passion hateful to my purposes;
A whole armado of convicted sail
A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,
A fearful eye thou hast; where is that blood
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
A thousand businesses are brief in hand,  
A cock'red silken wanton, brave our fields
A voluntary zeal and an unurg'd faith
A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
A Soothsayer
A Poet
A public place.
A wretched creature and must bend his body
A man of such a feeble temper should
A street. Thunder and lightning.
A man no mightier than thyself or me
A shrewd contriver; and you know his means,
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.
A woman well reputed, Cato's daughter.
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
A street near the Capitol.
A crowd of people, among them Artemidorus and the Soothsayer.
A Hail, Caesar! Read this schedule.
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
A street.
A house in Rome. Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus, seated at a table.
A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds
A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,
A little from this ground.
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
A canopy most fatal, under which
A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend.
A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe,
A Captain under Edmund's command.
A Herald.
A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
A credulous father! and a brother noble,
A little to disquantity your train,
A babe to honour her! If she must teem,  
A fox when one has caught her,
A court within the Castle of the Earl of Gloucester.
A childlike office.
A plague upon your epileptic visage!  
A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
A good man's fortune may grow out at heels.
A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle  
A heath.
A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.
A farmhouse near Gloucester's Castle.
A mistress's command. Wear this.          [Gives a favour.]
A father, and a gracious aged man,
A man, a prince, by him so benefited!  
A woman's shape doth shield thee.
A troop of horse with felt. I'll put't in proof,  
A plot upon her virtuous husband's life,
A drum afar off.
A tent in the French camp.
A field between the two camps.
A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'no,'
A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.
A FORESTER
A mild of grace and complete majesty-
A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
A man of complements, whom right and wrong
A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.
A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red.
A man of sovereign parts, peerless esteem'd,
A hundred thousand more, in surety of the which,
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast,
A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
A domineering pedant o'er the boy,
A woman, that is like a German clock,
A whitely wanton with a velvet brow,
A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.
A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
A green goose a goddess- pure, pure idolatry.
A caudle, ho!
A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,  
A leg, a limb-
A true man or a thief that gallops so?
A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
A wife of such wood were felicity.
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind.
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
A huge translation of hypocrisy,
A better speech was never spoke before.
A mean most meanly; and in ushering,
A world of torments though I should endure,
A mess of Russians left us but of late.
A man so breathed that certain he would fight ye,
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue.
A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,
A wife?
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
A Scottish Doctor
A Sergeant
A Porter
A desert place. Thunder and lightning.
A camp near Forres. Alarum within.
A heath. Thunder.
A prosperous gentleman; and to be King  
A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
A limbeck only. When in swinish sleep
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
A bell rings.
A little water clears us of this deed.
A fellow to it.
A falcon towering in her pride of place
A deed of dreadful note.
A park near the palace.
A Hall in the palace. A banquet prepared.
A woman's story at a winter's fire,
A heath. Thunder.
A cavern. In the middle, a boiling cauldron. Thunder.
A show of eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand;
A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
A stanchless avarice that, were I King,
A most miraculous work in this good King,
A modern ecstasy. The dead man's knell
A cry of women within.
A JUSTICE
A pow'r I have, but of what strength and nature
A street
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
A monastery
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
A nunnery
A novice of this place, and the fair sister
A warrant for his execution.
A hall in ANGELO'S house
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
A prison
A man already made, as to remit
A merriment than a vice.
A pond as deep as hell.
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
A word of this. What ho, within! come forth.  
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
A league below the city; and from thence,
A street near the city gate
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then  
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
A very scurvy fellow.  
A marble monument!
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds
A stage, where every man must play a part,
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
A breed for barren metal of his friend?-
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.                  Exit
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
A coin that bears the figure of an angel  
A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
A vessel of our country richly fraught.
A young Venetian, one that comes before
A day in April never came so sweet
A SONG
A golden mesh t' entrap the hearts of men
A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich,
A creature that did bear the shape of man
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
A many fools that stand in better place,
A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
A losing suit against him. Are you answered?
A messenger with letters from the doctor,
A young and learned doctor to our court.
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
A substitute shines brightly as a king
A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy
A prating boy that begg'd it as a fee;
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
A room in the Garter Inn
A field near Windsor
A field near Frogmore
A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.
A street leading to the Park
A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
A wood near Athens
A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king.
A merrier hour was never wasted there.
A sweet Athenian lady is in love
A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
A million fail, confounding oath on oath.
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.
A weak bond holds you; I'll not trust your word.
A local habitation and a name.
A lion fell, nor else no lion's dam;
A fortnight hold we this solemnity,
A Sexton.
A Boy.
A room in Leonato's house.
A hall in Leonato's house.
A hall in Leonato's house.
A room in Leonato's house.
A street.
A Room in Leonato's house.
A church.
A thousand times in secret.
A thousand blushing apparitions
A sin of perjury: she not denies it.
A prison.
A third is fled--that had a hand in it.
A churchyard.
A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
A Clown in service to Othello
A council chamber. The Duke and Senators sitting at a table;
A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.
A natural and prompt alacrity
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
A man he is of honesty and trust.  
A seaport in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.
A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements.
A Veronesa. Michael Cassio,
A cry within, "A sail, a sail, a sail!"
A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
A cry within, "A sail, a sail!" Guns heard.
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,
A street.
A hall in the castle.
A soldier's a man;
A cry within, "Help, help!"
A bell rings.
A Florentine more kind and honest.
A room in the castle.
A man that languishes in your displeasure.
A stranger to thy thoughts.
A sequester from liberty, fasting, and prayer,
A frank one.
A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
A passion most unsuiting such a man-
A housewife that by selling her desires
A room in the castle.
A closet lock and key of villainous secrets.
A drop of patience; but, alas, to make me
A fixed figure for the time of scorn
A bedchamber in the castle. Desdemona in bed asleep; a light burning.
A murther, which I thought a sacrifice.
A thousand times committed. Cassio confess'd it,
A better never did itself sustain
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;
A recreant and most degenerate traitor;
A jewel in a ten-times barr'd-up chest
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
A traitor to my God, my King, and me.
A loyal, just, and upright gentleman.  
A traitor to his God, his King, and him;
A long flourish, while the KING consults his Council
A dearer merit, not so deep a maim
A partial slander sought I to avoid,
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,
A parasite, a keeper-back of death,
A banish'd traitor. All my treasury
A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
A camp in Wales
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
A glorious angel. Then, if angels fight,
A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.
A little little grave, an obscure grave-
A brittle glory shineth in this face;
A plot shall show us all a merry day.                 Exeunt
A twofold marriage-'twixt my crown and me,
A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.
A beggar begs that never begg'd before.
A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
A YOUNG SON OF CLARENCE (Edward, Earl of Warwick)
A YOUNG DAUGHTER OF CLARENCE (Margaret Plantagenet,
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman-
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
A plague upon you all! His royal Grace-
A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too.
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
A liberal rewarder of his friends;
A husband and a son thou ow'st to me;
A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon,
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
A begging prince what beggar pities not?
A sennet.
A knot you are of damned blood-suckers.
A care-craz'd mother to a many sons,
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
A happy and a joyful time of day!
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
A king!-perhaps-
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
A dire induction am I witness to,
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death.
A mother only mock'd with two fair babes,
A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag
A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble,
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
A grievous burden was thy birth to me;
A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave
A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
A grandam's name is little less in love
A royal battle might be won and lost.
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
A base foul stone, made precious by the foil
A black day will it be to somebody.
A thing devised by the enemy.
A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
A scum of Britaines, and base lackey peasants,
A milk-sop, one that never in his life  
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!             Exeunt  
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.  
A Street.
A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;
A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.
A street.
A visor for a visor! What care I
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
A villain, that is hither come in spite
A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
A street.
A lover may bestride the gossamer
A public place.
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
A gentleman of princely parentage,
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.  
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
A precious ring- a ring that I must use
A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
A lightning before death. O, how may I
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
A greater power than we can contradict
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
A LORD
A PEDANT
A WIDOW
A most delicious banquet by his bed,
A bedchamber in the LORD'S house
A flourish of trumpets announces the play
A course of learning and ingenious studies.
A merchant of great traffic through the world,
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
A man well known throughout all Italy.
A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack,
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
A horse and a man
A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
A merchant of incomparable wealth.
A velvet dish. Fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy;
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap.
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie;
A public road
A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled-
A ship at sea; afterwards an uninhabited island
A time before we came unto this cell?
A prince of power.
A falsehood, in its contrary as great
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
A treacherous army levied, one midnight
A mark so bloody on the business; but
A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg'd,
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
A most auspicious star, whose influence
A dozen years; within which space she died,
A freckl'd whelp, hag-born-not honour'd with
A human shape.
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows,
A thing divine; for nothing natural
A matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,  
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king-
A contract of true love; be not too late.  
A noise of hunters beard. Enter divers SPIRITS, in
A solemn air, and the best comforter
A hearty welcome.
A vision of the island, one dear son
A heaviness that's gone.

A FOOL
A thousand moral paintings I can show
A gentleman that well deserves a help,
A room of state in TIMON'S house
A SENATOR'S house
A visage of demand; for I do fear,
A thousand talents to me.
A public place
A hall in TIMON'S house
A moderate table.
A banqueting hall in TIMON'S house

A pox of wrinkles!
A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'st
A stone by thee.                     [Throws a stone at him]
A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal
A CAPTAIN
A MESSENGER
A CLOWN
A NURSE, and a black CHILD
A special party, have by common voice
A nobler man, a braver warrior,
A mother's tears in passion for her son;
A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;
A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.
A father and a friend to thee and Rome.
A Roman now adopted happily,
A speedier course than ling'ring languishment
A forest near Rome
A lonely part of the forest
A very excellent piece of villainy.
A barren detested vale you see it is:
A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
A very fatal place it seems to me.
A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints;
A precious ring that lightens all this hole,
A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
A stone is soft as wax: tribunes more hard than stones.
A stone is silent and offendeth not,
A banquet.
A deed of death done on the innocent
A joyful issue.
A long-tongu'd babbling gossip? No, lords, no.
A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?
A halter, soldiers! Hang him on this tree,
A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam.
A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant  
A ROMAN. You sad Andronici, have done with woes;
A Prologue arm'd, but not in confidence
A lord of Troyan blood, nephew to Hector;
A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
A stranger to those most imperial looks
A prince called Hector-Priam is his father-
A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
A form of strangeness as we pass along.  
A very horse that has he knows not what!  
A great-siz'd monster of ingratitudes.
A woman impudent and mannish grown
A labour sav'd!
A thousand complete courses of the sun!
A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple  
A Troyan hath been slain; since she could speak,
A priest, there off'ring to it his own heart.                Exit
A victor shall be known? Will you the knights
A little proudly, and great deal misprizing
A second hope as fairly built as Hector.
A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;
A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
A great addition earned in thy death.
A thought of added honour torn from Hector.
A drop of Grecian blood. The end crowns all;
A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?
A token from her daughter, my fair love,
A guard of patience. Stay a little while.
A SEA CAPTAIN, friend of Viola
A city in Illyria; and the sea-coast near it
A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh  
A gracious person; but yet I cannot love him.

A most extracting frenzy of mine own

A foolish thing was but a toy,
A great while ago the world begun,
A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had buried her grandam;
A journey to my loving Proteus.
A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears,
A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,
A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears;
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,
A man I am cross'd with adversity;
A linguist, and a man of such perfection
A slave that still an end turns me to shame!  
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful!
A smaller boon than this I cannot beg,
A MARINER
A GAOLER
A servant grafted in my serious trust,
A lip of much contempt, speeds from me;
A party in this alteration, finding
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril  
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
A federary with her, and one that knows
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
A school-boy's top. Away with her to prison.
A thriving issue; there is no lady living
A man, the worst about you.
A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door!
A most intelligencing bawd!
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence,
A just and open trial. While she lives,
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
A moiety of the throne, a great king's daughter,
A lady like me; with a love even such,
A lullaby too rough; I never saw
A merry heart goes all the day,
A ram and bleated; and the fire-rob'd god,
A way to make us better friends, more known.
A fair one are you- well you fit our ages
A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
A wave o' th' sea, that you might ever do
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepar'd
A place whereto you'll go?
A great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking on's teeth.
A saint-like sorrow. No fault could you make
A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
A graceful gentleman, against whose person,
A shepherd's daughter.
A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far-
A LOVER'S COMPLAINT
A plaintful story from a sist'ring vale,
A thousand favours from a maund she drew  
A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh,
A youthful suit- it was to gain my grace-
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted
A man in hue all hues in his controlling,
A dearer birth than this his love had brought
A loss in love that touches me more nearly.  
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,
A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
A third nor red, nor white, had stol'n of both,
A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
A god in love, to whom I am confined.
A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe,
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face,
A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
A dateless lively heat still to endure,
A PAGE, Servant to the Countess of Rousillon
A WIDOW OF FLORENCE.
A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,
A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,
A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;  
A braving war.
A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
A native slip to us from foreign seeds.
A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
A senseless help, when help past sense we deem.
A modest one to bear me back again.
A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame,
A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
A poor physician's daughter-thou dislik'st
A lying trophy; and as oft is dumb
A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
A balance more replete.
A young man married is a man that's marr'd.
A very serious business calls on him.
A charge too heavy for my strength; but yet
A lover of thy drum, hater of love.                   Exeunt
A tucket afar off. Enter an old WIDOW OF FLORENCE, her daughter DIANA,
A shrewd turn, if she pleas'd.
A wife of me, though there my hope be done.
A stranger, no offender; and inform him
A SOOTHSAYER
A CLOWN
A little I can read.
A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
A man who is the abstract of all faults
A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
A space for farther travel.
A better ear. Menas, I did not think
A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense  
A blessed lottery to him.
A meaner than myself; since I myself
A cistern for scal'd snakes! Go, get thee hence.
A sennet sounded. Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS,
A plain in Syria
A statue than a breather.
A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented
A soldier and his horse.
A plain near Actium
A most unnoble swerving.
A private man in Athens. This for him.
A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
A diminution in our captain's brain
A mangled shadow. Perchance to-morrow
A workman in't.
A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
A shrewd one to's.
A master-leaver and a fugitive!
A hill near Alexandria
A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
A forked mountain, or blue promontory
A million moe, now lost- she, Eros, has
A nobleness in record. But I will be
A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
A greater crack. The round world
A moiety of the world.
A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar:
A minister of her will; and it is great
A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly
A sun and moon, which kept their course and lighted
A benefit in this change; but if you seek
A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
A pair so famous. High events as these
A person representing HYMEN
A lawn before the DUKE'S palace
A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
A boar spear in my hand; and- in my heart
A thievish living on the common road?
A stubborn will to please,
A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and LORDS, like outlaws
A motley fool. A miserable world!  
A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
A scatt'red smile, and that I'll live upon.
A little riper and more lusty red
A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,
A sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?
A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,
A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
A COURTEZAN
A hall in the DUKE'S palace
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
A mean woman was delivered
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
A man is master of his liberty;
A wretched soul, bruis'd with adversity,
A sunny look of his would soon repair.
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish.
A vulgar comment will be made of it,
A husband's office? Shall, Antipholus,
A public place
A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;
A wolf, nay worse, a fellow all in buff;
A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands
A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dry-foot well;
A chain, a chain. Do you not hear it ring?
A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
A nut, a cherry-stone;
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
A street
A street before a priory
A sin prevailing much in youthful men
A charitable duty of my order;
A most outrageous fit of madness took him,
A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,
A needy, hollow-ey'd, sharp-looking wretch,
A living dead man. This pernicious slave,

A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
A place below the first; for what miscarries
A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
A field of battle between the Roman and the Volscian camps
A bribe to pay my sword. I do refuse it,
A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius, Marcius!'
A flourish. Cornets. Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS bloody, with two or three soldiers
A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the

A sure destruction.

A sennet. Enter the PATRICIANS and the TRIBUNES
A little of that worthy work perform'd
A kinder value of the people than
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
A place of potency and sway o' th' state,
A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labour'd,
A man of their infirmity.
A noble life before a long, and wish
A foe to th' public weal. Obey, I charge thee,
A brand to th' end o' th' world.
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't;
A most inherent baseness.
A noble cunning. You were us'd to load me
A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
A highway between Rome and Antium
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter

A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
A city full; of tribunes such as you,
A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
A good construction. I rais'd him, and I pawn'd

A seat for baseness.
A lustre to it.
A man worth any woman; overbuys me
A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
A drop of blood a day and, being aged,
A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect
A sly and constant knave,
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady
A Gallian girl at home. He furnaces
A saucy stranger in his court to mart  
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer  
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,
A pantler- not so eminent!
A second night of such sweet shortness which  
A pudency so rosy, the sweet view on't
A world by itself, and we will nothing pay
A riding suit, no costlier than would fit
A franklin's huswife.
A cell of ignorance, travelling abed,
A prison for a debtor that not dares
A pain that only seems to seek out danger
A storm, or robbery, call it what you will,
A look untender! If't be summer news,
A little witness my obedience. Look!
A strain of rareness; and I grieve myself
A man already.

A headless man? The garments of Posthumus?
A very valiant Briton and a good,
A grave. Come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd
A fever with the absence of her son;
A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,
A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel
A very drudge of nature's, have subdu'd me
A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,  
A stop i' th' chaser, a retire; anon
A rout, confusion thick. Forthwith they fly,
A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.
A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again
A thing of pity.
A father to me; and thou hast created
A mother and two brothers. But, O scorn,
A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer.
A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,
A shop of all the qualities that man
A sacrilegious thief, to do't. The temple

A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,

A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
A scullion!  
A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
A second time I kill my husband dead
A very, very- pajock.
A room in the Castle.
A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
A villain kills my father; and for that,
A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
A station like the herald Mercury
A combination and a form indeed
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
A noise within.
A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
A face without a heart,'
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
A very noble youth. Mark.
A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
A table and flagons of wine on it.

A thousand of his people butchered;
A gallant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not?
A son who is the theme of honour's tongue,
A pouncet box, which ever and anon
A plague upon it! it is in GIoucestershire-  
A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed,
A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
A gross fat man.
A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.
A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
A virtue that was never seen in you.
A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,
A couching lion and a ramping cat,
A good mouth-filling oath; and leave 'in sooth'
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
A mighty and a fearful head they are,
A comfort of retirement lives in this.
A larger dare to our great enterprise,
A public road near Coventry.
A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
A prodigy of fear, and a portent
A hare-brained Hotspur govern'd by a spleen.
A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,
A sword whose temper I intend to stain
A second time do such a courtesy.
A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;
A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear:
A very valiant rebel of the name.  
A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
A retreat is sounded.
A noble earl, and many a creature else
A gentleman well bred and of good name,
A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,
A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,
A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
A naked subject to the weeping clouds
A dozen captains stay at door for you.
A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?  
A certain instance that Glendower is dead.
A rotten case abides no handling.
A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,
A ragged and forestall'd remission.
A cup of wine, sir?
A cup of wine that's brisk and fine,
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,
A hundred alms-houses right well supplied;
A thousand pounds by th' year: thus runs the bill.
A fearful battle rend'red you in music.
A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'
A little cloth.
A night is but small breath and little pause
A city on th' inconstant billows dancing;
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,
A damned death!
A largess universal, like the sun,
A little touch of Harry in the night.
A good soft pillow for that good white head  
A lad of life, an imp of fame;
A very little little let us do,
A many of our bodies shall no doubt
A testament of noble-ending love.

A woman clad in armour chaseth them.
A witch by fear, not force, like Hannibal,
A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear
A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd;

A thousand souls to death and deadly night.
A man of thy profession and degree;
A prophet to the fall of all our foes!
A braver soldier never couched lance,
A gentler heart did never sway in court;
A stouter champion never handled sword.
A letter was deliver'd to my hands,
A little herd of England's timorous deer,
A terrible and unavoided danger;
A field of battle
A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.

A world of earthly blessings to my soul,
A day will come when York shall claim his own;
A spirit rais'd from depth of underground
A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!
A sorry breakfast for my Lord Protector.
A man that ne'er saw in his life before.
A hundred times and oft'ner, in my sleep,
A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,
A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.
A heart it was, bound in with diamonds-
A wilderness is populous enough,
A cunning man did calculate my birth  
A Roman sworder and banditto slave
A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul
A poor esquire of Kent that loves his king.
A NOBLEMAN                         TWO KEEPERS
A HUNTSMAN
A SON that has killed his father
A FATHER that has killed his son
A woman's general; what should we fear?  
A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'  
A bird that will revenge upon you all;
A crown for York!-and, lords, bow low to him.
A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire
A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day
A field of battle between Towton and Saxton, in Yorkshire
A loud alarum. Enter CLIFFORD, wounded
A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.
A chase in the north of England
A man at least, for less I should not be;
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
A cold premeditation for my purpose!
A plain in Warwickshire
A park near Middleham Castle in Yorkshire
A salve for any sore that may betide.
A parley, sirrah, to George of Clarence.
A field of battle near Barnet
A CRIER
A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
A man may weep upon his wedding-day.
A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys  
A place next to the King.
A new hell in himself.
A most poor issue?
A thing inspir'd, and, not consulting, broke
A minister in his power. You know his nature,
A full hot horse, who being allow'd his way,
A noise within, crying 'Room for the Queen!'
A single voice; and that not pass'd me but
A trembling contribution! Why, we take  
A fit or two o' th' face; but they are shrewd ones;
A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.
A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong  
A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;
A good digestion to you all; and once more
A noble company! What are their pleasures?
A thousand thanks, and pray 'em take their pleasures.
A little happier than my wretched father;
A most unnatural and faithless service.
A strong faith to conceal it.
A buzzing of a separation
A woman of less place might ask by law-
A thousand pound a year, annual support,
A very fresh-fish here-fie, fie, fie upon
A thousand pounds a year for pure respect!  
A prince most prudent, of an excellent
A year before. It is not to be question'd  
A better wife, let him in nought be trusted
A royal lady, spake one the least word that might
A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and
A strange tongue makes my cause more strange, suspicious;
A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?
A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,
A soul as even as a calm. Pray think us
A creature of the Queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'
A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain
A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to
A loyal and obedient subject is
A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune,
A league between his Highness and Ferrara.
A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,
A peace above all earthly dignities,
A still and quiet conscience. The King has cur'd me,
A load would sink a navy-too much honour.
A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.
A street in Westminster
A distance from her, while her Grace sat down
A man in much esteem with th' King, and truly
A worthy friend. The King has made him Master
A gentleman, sent from the King, to see you.
A right good husband, let him be a noble;
A queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.
A most arch heretic, a pestilence  
A quiet night, and my good mistress will  
A man of his place, and so near our favour,
A Council table brought in, with chairs and stools, and placed
A man that more detests, more stirs against,
A shrewd turn and he's your friend for ever.'
A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.
A pattern to all princes living with her,
A most unspotted lily shall she pass
A soldier by the honour-giving hand
A half-fac'd groat five hundred pound a year!
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
A foot of honour better than I was;
A will that bars the title of thy son.
A woman's will; a cank'red grandam's will!
A peaceful progress to the ocean.
A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,
A widow, husbandless, subject to fears;
A woman, naturally born to fears;
A widow cries: Be husband to me, heavens!
A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear
A mother's curse-on her revolting son.
A chafed lion by the mortal paw,
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
A rage whose heat hath this condition
A passion hateful to my purposes;
A whole armado of convicted sail
A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,
A fearful eye thou hast; where is that blood
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
A thousand businesses are brief in hand,  
A cock'red silken wanton, brave our fields
A voluntary zeal and an unurg'd faith
A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
A Soothsayer
A Poet
A public place.
A wretched creature and must bend his body
A man of such a feeble temper should
A street. Thunder and lightning.
A man no mightier than thyself or me
A shrewd contriver; and you know his means,
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.
A woman well reputed, Cato's daughter.
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
A street near the Capitol.
A crowd of people, among them Artemidorus and the Soothsayer.
A Hail, Caesar! Read this schedule.
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
A street.
A house in Rome. Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus, seated at a table.
A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds
A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,
A little from this ground.
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
A canopy most fatal, under which
A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend.
A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe,
A Captain under Edmund's command.
A Herald.
A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
A credulous father! and a brother noble,
A little to disquantity your train,
A babe to honour her! If she must teem,  
A fox when one has caught her,
A court within the Castle of the Earl of Gloucester.
A childlike office.
A plague upon your epileptic visage!  
A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
A good man's fortune may grow out at heels.
A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle  
A heath.
A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.
A farmhouse near Gloucester's Castle.
A mistress's command. Wear this.          [Gives a favour.]
A father, and a gracious aged man,
A man, a prince, by him so benefited!  
A woman's shape doth shield thee.
A troop of horse with felt. I'll put't in proof,  
A plot upon her virtuous husband's life,
A drum afar off.
A tent in the French camp.
A field between the two camps.
A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'no,'
A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.
A FORESTER
A mild of grace and complete majesty-
A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
A man of complements, whom right and wrong
A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.
A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red.
A man of sovereign parts, peerless esteem'd,
A hundred thousand more, in surety of the which,
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast,
A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
A domineering pedant o'er the boy,
A woman, that is like a German clock,
A whitely wanton with a velvet brow,
A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.
A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
A green goose a goddess- pure, pure idolatry.
A caudle, ho!
A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,  
A leg, a limb-
A true man or a thief that gallops so?
A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
A wife of such wood were felicity.
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind.
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
A huge translation of hypocrisy,
A better speech was never spoke before.
A mean most meanly; and in ushering,
A world of torments though I should endure,
A mess of Russians left us but of late.
A man so breathed that certain he would fight ye,
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue.
A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,
A wife?
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
A Scottish Doctor
A Sergeant
A Porter
A desert place. Thunder and lightning.
A camp near Forres. Alarum within.
A heath. Thunder.
A prosperous gentleman; and to be King  
A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
A limbeck only. When in swinish sleep
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
A bell rings.
A little water clears us of this deed.
A fellow to it.
A falcon towering in her pride of place
A deed of dreadful note.
A park near the palace.
A Hall in the palace. A banquet prepared.
A woman's story at a winter's fire,
A heath. Thunder.
A cavern. In the middle, a boiling cauldron. Thunder.
A show of eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand;
A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
A stanchless avarice that, were I King,
A most miraculous work in this good King,
A modern ecstasy. The dead man's knell
A cry of women within.
A JUSTICE
A pow'r I have, but of what strength and nature
A street
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
A monastery
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
A nunnery
A novice of this place, and the fair sister
A warrant for his execution.
A hall in ANGELO'S house
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
A prison
A man already made, as to remit
A merriment than a vice.
A pond as deep as hell.
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
A word of this. What ho, within! come forth.  
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
A league below the city; and from thence,
A street near the city gate
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then  
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
A very scurvy fellow.  
A marble monument!
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds
A stage, where every man must play a part,
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
A breed for barren metal of his friend?-
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.                  Exit
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
A coin that bears the figure of an angel  
A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
A vessel of our country richly fraught.
A young Venetian, one that comes before
A day in April never came so sweet
A SONG
A golden mesh t' entrap the hearts of men
A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich,
A creature that did bear the shape of man
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
A many fools that stand in better place,
A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
A losing suit against him. Are you answered?
A messenger with letters from the doctor,
A young and learned doctor to our court.
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
A substitute shines brightly as a king
A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy
A prating boy that begg'd it as a fee;
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
A room in the Garter Inn
A field near Windsor
A field near Frogmore
A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.
A street leading to the Park
A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
A wood near Athens
A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king.
A merrier hour was never wasted there.
A sweet Athenian lady is in love
A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
A million fail, confounding oath on oath.
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.
A weak bond holds you; I'll not trust your word.
A local habitation and a name.
A lion fell, nor else no lion's dam;
A fortnight hold we this solemnity,
A Sexton.
A Boy.
A room in Leonato's house.
A hall in Leonato's house.
A hall in Leonato's house.
A room in Leonato's house.
A street.
A Room in Leonato's house.
A church.
A thousand times in secret.
A thousand blushing apparitions
A sin of perjury: she not denies it.
A prison.
A third is fled--that had a hand in it.
A churchyard.
A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
A Clown in service to Othello
A council chamber. The Duke and Senators sitting at a table;
A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.
A natural and prompt alacrity
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
A man he is of honesty and trust.  
A seaport in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.
A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements.
A Veronesa. Michael Cassio,
A cry within, "A sail, a sail, a sail!"
A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
A cry within, "A sail, a sail!" Guns heard.
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,
A street.
A hall in the castle.
A soldier's a man;
A cry within, "Help, help!"
A bell rings.
A Florentine more kind and honest.
A room in the castle.
A man that languishes in your displeasure.
A stranger to thy thoughts.
A sequester from liberty, fasting, and prayer,
A frank one.
A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
A passion most unsuiting such a man-
A housewife that by selling her desires
A room in the castle.
A closet lock and key of villainous secrets.
A drop of patience; but, alas, to make me
A fixed figure for the time of scorn
A bedchamber in the castle. Desdemona in bed asleep; a light burning.
A murther, which I thought a sacrifice.
A thousand times committed. Cassio confess'd it,
A better never did itself sustain
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;
A recreant and most degenerate traitor;
A jewel in a ten-times barr'd-up chest
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
A traitor to my God, my King, and me.
A loyal, just, and upright gentleman.  
A traitor to his God, his King, and him;
A long flourish, while the KING consults his Council
A dearer merit, not so deep a maim
A partial slander sought I to avoid,
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,
A parasite, a keeper-back of death,
A banish'd traitor. All my treasury
A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
A camp in Wales
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
A glorious angel. Then, if angels fight,
A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.
A little little grave, an obscure grave-
A brittle glory shineth in this face;
A plot shall show us all a merry day.                 Exeunt
A twofold marriage-'twixt my crown and me,
A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.
A beggar begs that never begg'd before.
A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
A YOUNG SON OF CLARENCE (Edward, Earl of Warwick)
A YOUNG DAUGHTER OF CLARENCE (Margaret Plantagenet,
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman-
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
A plague upon you all! His royal Grace-
A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too.
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
A liberal rewarder of his friends;
A husband and a son thou ow'st to me;
A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon,
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
A begging prince what beggar pities not?
A sennet.
A knot you are of damned blood-suckers.
A care-craz'd mother to a many sons,
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
A happy and a joyful time of day!
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
A king!-perhaps-
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
A dire induction am I witness to,
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death.
A mother only mock'd with two fair babes,
A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag
A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble,
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
A grievous burden was thy birth to me;
A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave
A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
A grandam's name is little less in love
A royal battle might be won and lost.
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
A base foul stone, made precious by the foil
A black day will it be to somebody.
A thing devised by the enemy.
A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
A scum of Britaines, and base lackey peasants,
A milk-sop, one that never in his life  
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!             Exeunt  
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.  
A Street.
A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;
A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.
A street.
A visor for a visor! What care I
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
A villain, that is hither come in spite
A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
A street.
A lover may bestride the gossamer
A public place.
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
A gentleman of princely parentage,
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.  
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
A precious ring- a ring that I must use
A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
A lightning before death. O, how may I
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
A greater power than we can contradict
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
A LORD
A PEDANT
A WIDOW
A most delicious banquet by his bed,
A bedchamber in the LORD'S house
A flourish of trumpets announces the play
A course of learning and ingenious studies.
A merchant of great traffic through the world,
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
A man well known throughout all Italy.
A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack,
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
A horse and a man
A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
A merchant of incomparable wealth.
A velvet dish. Fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy;
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap.
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie;
A public road
A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled-
A ship at sea; afterwards an uninhabited island
A time before we came unto this cell?
A prince of power.
A falsehood, in its contrary as great
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
A treacherous army levied, one midnight
A mark so bloody on the business; but
A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg'd,
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
A most auspicious star, whose influence
A dozen years; within which space she died,
A freckl'd whelp, hag-born-not honour'd with
A human shape.
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows,
A thing divine; for nothing natural
A matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,  
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king-
A contract of true love; be not too late.  
A noise of hunters beard. Enter divers SPIRITS, in
A solemn air, and the best comforter
A hearty welcome.
A vision of the island, one dear son
A heaviness that's gone.

A gentleman that well deserves a help,
A room of state in TIMON'S house
A SENATOR'S house
A visage of demand; for I do fear,
A thousand talents to me.
A public place
A hall in TIMON'S house
A moderate table.
A banqueting hall in TIMON'S house
A dedicated beggar to the air,
A pox of wrinkles!
A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'st
A stone by thee.                     [Throws a stone at him]
A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal
A CAPTAIN
A MESSENGER
A CLOWN
A NURSE, and a black CHILD
A special party, have by common voice
A nobler man, a braver warrior,
A mother's tears in passion for her son;
A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;
A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.
A father and a friend to thee and Rome.
A Roman now adopted happily,
A speedier course than ling'ring languishment
A forest near Rome
A lonely part of the forest
A very excellent piece of villainy.
A barren detested vale you see it is:
A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
A very fatal place it seems to me.
A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints;
A precious ring that lightens all this hole,
A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
A stone is soft as wax: tribunes more hard than stones.
A stone is silent and offendeth not,
A banquet.
A deed of death done on the innocent
A joyful issue.
A long-tongu'd babbling gossip? No, lords, no.
A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?
A halter, soldiers! Hang him on this tree,
A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam.
A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant  
A ROMAN. You sad Andronici, have done with woes;
A Prologue arm'd, but not in confidence
A lord of Troyan blood, nephew to Hector;
A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
A stranger to those most imperial looks
A prince called Hector-Priam is his father-
A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
A form of strangeness as we pass along.  
A very horse that has he knows not what!  
A great-siz'd monster of ingratitudes.
A woman impudent and mannish grown
A labour sav'd!
A thousand complete courses of the sun!
A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple  
A Troyan hath been slain; since she could speak,
A priest, there off'ring to it his own heart.                Exit
A victor shall be known? Will you the knights
A little proudly, and great deal misprizing
A second hope as fairly built as Hector.
A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;
A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
A great addition earned in thy death.
A thought of added honour torn from Hector.
A drop of Grecian blood. The end crowns all;
A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?
A token from her daughter, my fair love,
A guard of patience. Stay a little while.
A SEA CAPTAIN, friend of Viola
A city in Illyria; and the sea-coast near it
A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh  
A gracious person; but yet I cannot love him.
A street
A stoup of wine, Maria!
A thousand thousand to save,
A ring in chase of you; so did I abuse
A murd'rous guilt shows not itself more soon

A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.           Exit
A baubling vessel was he captain of,
A natural perspective, that is and is not.
A gentleman and follower of my lady's.
A most extracting frenzy of mine own
A solemn combination shall be made
A foolish thing was but a toy,
A great while ago the world begun,
A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had buried her grandam;
A journey to my loving Proteus.
A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears,
A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,
A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears;
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,
A man I am cross'd with adversity;
A linguist, and a man of such perfection
A slave that still an end turns me to shame!  
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful!
A smaller boon than this I cannot beg,
A MARINER
A GAOLER
A servant grafted in my serious trust,
A lip of much contempt, speeds from me;
A party in this alteration, finding
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril  
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
A federary with her, and one that knows
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
A school-boy's top. Away with her to prison.
A thriving issue; there is no lady living
A man, the worst about you.
A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door!
A most intelligencing bawd!
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence,
A just and open trial. While she lives,
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
A moiety of the throne, a great king's daughter,
A lady like me; with a love even such,
A lullaby too rough; I never saw
A merry heart goes all the day,
A ram and bleated; and the fire-rob'd god,
A way to make us better friends, more known.
A fair one are you- well you fit our ages
A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
A wave o' th' sea, that you might ever do
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepar'd
A place whereto you'll go?
A great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking on's teeth.
A saint-like sorrow. No fault could you make
A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
A graceful gentleman, against whose person,
A shepherd's daughter.
A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far-
A LOVER'S COMPLAINT
A plaintful story from a sist'ring vale,
A thousand favours from a maund she drew  
A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh,
A youthful suit- it was to gain my grace-
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted
A man in hue all hues in his controlling,
A dearer birth than this his love had brought
A loss in love that touches me more nearly.  
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,
A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
A third nor red, nor white, had stol'n of both,
A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
A god in love, to whom I am confined.
A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe,
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face,
A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
A dateless lively heat still to endure,

A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;  
A braving war.
A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
A native slip to us from foreign seeds.
A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
A senseless help, when help past sense we deem.
A modest one to bear me back again.
A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame,
A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
A poor physician's daughter-thou dislik'st
A lying trophy; and as oft is dumb
A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
A balance more replete.
A young man married is a man that's marr'd.
A very serious business calls on him.
A charge too heavy for my strength; but yet
A lover of thy drum, hater of love.                   Exeunt
A tucket afar off. Enter an old WIDOW OF FLORENCE, her daughter DIANA,
A shrewd turn, if she pleas'd.
A wife of me, though there my hope be done.
A stranger, no offender; and inform him
A SOOTHSAYER
A CLOWN
A little I can read.
A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
A man who is the abstract of all faults
A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
A space for farther travel.
A better ear. Menas, I did not think
A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense  
A blessed lottery to him.
A meaner than myself; since I myself
A cistern for scal'd snakes! Go, get thee hence.
A sennet sounded. Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS,
A plain in Syria
A statue than a breather.
A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented
A soldier and his horse.
A plain near Actium
A most unnoble swerving.
A private man in Athens. This for him.
A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
A diminution in our captain's brain
A mangled shadow. Perchance to-morrow
A workman in't.
A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
A shrewd one to's.
A master-leaver and a fugitive!
A hill near Alexandria
A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
A forked mountain, or blue promontory
A million moe, now lost- she, Eros, has
A nobleness in record. But I will be
A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
A greater crack. The round world
A moiety of the world.
A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar:
A minister of her will; and it is great
A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly
A sun and moon, which kept their course and lighted
A benefit in this change; but if you seek
A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
A pair so famous. High events as these
A person representing HYMEN
A lawn before the DUKE'S palace
A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
A boar spear in my hand; and- in my heart
A thievish living on the common road?
A stubborn will to please,
A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and LORDS, like outlaws
A motley fool. A miserable world!  
A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
A scatt'red smile, and that I'll live upon.
A little riper and more lusty red
A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,
A sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?
A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,
A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
A COURTEZAN
A hall in the DUKE'S palace
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
A mean woman was delivered
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
A man is master of his liberty;
A wretched soul, bruis'd with adversity,
A sunny look of his would soon repair.
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish.
A vulgar comment will be made of it,
A husband's office? Shall, Antipholus,
A public place
A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;
A wolf, nay worse, a fellow all in buff;
A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands
A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dry-foot well;
A chain, a chain. Do you not hear it ring?
A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
A nut, a cherry-stone;
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
A street
A street before a priory
A sin prevailing much in youthful men
A charitable duty of my order;
A most outrageous fit of madness took him,
A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,
A needy, hollow-ey'd, sharp-looking wretch,
A living dead man. This pernicious slave,
A ROMAN HERALD
A CITIZEN of Antium  
A pretty tale. It may be you have heard it;
A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
A place below the first; for what miscarries
A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
A field of battle between the Roman and the Volscian camps
A bribe to pay my sword. I do refuse it,
A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius, Marcius!'
A flourish. Cornets. Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS bloody, with two or three soldiers
A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the
A curse begin at very root on's heart
A sure destruction.
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
A sennet. Enter the PATRICIANS and the TRIBUNES
A little of that worthy work perform'd
A kinder value of the people than
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
A place of potency and sway o' th' state,
A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labour'd,
A man of their infirmity.
A noble life before a long, and wish
A foe to th' public weal. Obey, I charge thee,
A brand to th' end o' th' world.
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't;
A most inherent baseness.
A noble cunning. You were us'd to load me
A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
A highway between Rome and Antium
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
A worthy officer i' the war, but insolent,
A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
A camp at a short distance from Rome
A noble servant to them, but he could not
A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
A pair of tribunes that have wrack'd for Rome
A private whisper- no, not with such friends
A mother less, or granted less, Aufidius?
A better witness back than words, which we,
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
A city full; of tribunes such as you,
A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
A good construction. I rais'd him, and I pawn'd
A twist of rotten silk; never admitting
A FRENCH GENTLEMAN, friend to Philario
A ROMAN CAPTAIN
A sample to the youngest; to th' more mature
A glass that feated them; and to the graver
A child that guided dotards. To his mistress,
A year's age on me!
A seat for baseness.
A lustre to it.
A man worth any woman; overbuys me
A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
A drop of blood a day and, being aged,
A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect
A sly and constant knave,
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady
A Gallian girl at home. He furnaces
A saucy stranger in his court to mart  
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer  
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,
A pantler- not so eminent!
A second night of such sweet shortness which  
A pudency so rosy, the sweet view on't
A world by itself, and we will nothing pay
A riding suit, no costlier than would fit
A franklin's huswife.
A cell of ignorance, travelling abed,
A prison for a debtor that not dares
A pain that only seems to seek out danger
A storm, or robbery, call it what you will,
A look untender! If't be summer news,
A little witness my obedience. Look!
A strain of rareness; and I grieve myself
A man already.
A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.
A conduct overland to Milford Haven.
A thing more made of malice than of duty;
A dram of worth be drawn.
A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,
A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
A law-breaker, a villain. Yield thee, thief.
A headless man? The garments of Posthumus?
A very valiant Briton and a good,
A grave. Come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd
A fever with the absence of her son;
A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,
A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel
A very drudge of nature's, have subdu'd me
A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,  
A stop i' th' chaser, a retire; anon
A rout, confusion thick. Forthwith they fly,
A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.
A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again
A thing of pity.
A father to me; and thou hast created
A mother and two brothers. But, O scorn,
A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer.
A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,
A shop of all the qualities that man
A sacrilegious thief, to do't. The temple
A precious thing! I had it from the Queen.
A certain stuff, which, being ta'en would cease
A banish'd traitor.
A pair of worthier sons.
A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother
A Roman and a British ensign wave
A Gentleman, courtier.
A Priest.
A Norwegian Captain.
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
A sable silver'd.
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
A double blessing is a double grace;
A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-  
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
A scullion!  
A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
A second time I kill my husband dead
A very, very- pajock.
A room in the Castle.
A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
A villain kills my father; and for that,
A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
A station like the herald Mercury
A combination and a form indeed
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
A noise within.
A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
A face without a heart,'
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
A very noble youth. Mark.
A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
A table and flagons of wine on it.  
A post from Wales, loaden with heavy news;
A thousand of his people butchered;
A gallant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not?
A son who is the theme of honour's tongue,
A pouncet box, which ever and anon
A plague upon it! it is in GIoucestershire-  
A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed,
A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
A gross fat man.
A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.
A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
A virtue that was never seen in you.
A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,
A couching lion and a ramping cat,
A good mouth-filling oath; and leave 'in sooth'
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
A mighty and a fearful head they are,
A comfort of retirement lives in this.
A larger dare to our great enterprise,
A public road near Coventry.
A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
A prodigy of fear, and a portent
A hare-brained Hotspur govern'd by a spleen.
A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,
A sword whose temper I intend to stain
A second time do such a courtesy.
A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;
A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear:
A very valiant rebel of the name.  
A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
A retreat is sounded.
A noble earl, and many a creature else
A gentleman well bred and of good name,
A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,
A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,
A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
A naked subject to the weeping clouds
A dozen captains stay at door for you.
A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?  
A certain instance that Glendower is dead.
A rotten case abides no handling.
A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,
A ragged and forestall'd remission.
A cup of wine, sir?
A cup of wine that's brisk and fine,
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,
A hundred alms-houses right well supplied;
A thousand pounds by th' year: thus runs the bill.
A fearful battle rend'red you in music.
A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'
A little cloth.
A night is but small breath and little pause
A city on th' inconstant billows dancing;
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,
A damned death!
A largess universal, like the sun,
A little touch of Harry in the night.
A good soft pillow for that good white head  
A lad of life, an imp of fame;
A very little little let us do,
A many of our bodies shall no doubt
A testament of noble-ending love.
A LAWYER
A FRENCH SERGEANT
A PORTER
A far more glorious star thy soul will make
A third thinks, without expense at all,
A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,
A holy maid hither with me I bring,
A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have plac'd;
A holy prophetess new risen up,
A woman clad in armour chaseth them.
A witch by fear, not force, like Hannibal,
A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear
A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd;
A second Hector, for his grim aspect
A thousand souls to death and deadly night.
A man of thy profession and degree;
A prophet to the fall of all our foes!
A braver soldier never couched lance,
A gentler heart did never sway in court;
A stouter champion never handled sword.
A letter was deliver'd to my hands,
A little herd of England's timorous deer,
A terrible and unavoided danger;
A field of battle
A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.
A man of great authority in France,
A goodly prize, fit for the devil's grace!
A virgin, and his servant, say to him.
A virgin from her tender infancy,
A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
A LIEUTENANT, a SHIPMASTER, a MASTER'S MATE, and WALTER WHITMORE  
A SPIRIT raised by him
A world of earthly blessings to my soul,
A day will come when York shall claim his own;
A spirit rais'd from depth of underground
A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!
A sorry breakfast for my Lord Protector.
A man that ne'er saw in his life before.
A hundred times and oft'ner, in my sleep,
A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,
A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.
A heart it was, bound in with diamonds-
A wilderness is populous enough,
A cunning man did calculate my birth  
A Roman sworder and banditto slave
A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul
A poor esquire of Kent that loves his king.
A NOBLEMAN                         TWO KEEPERS
A HUNTSMAN
A SON that has killed his father
A FATHER that has killed his son
A woman's general; what should we fear?  
A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'  
A bird that will revenge upon you all;
A crown for York!-and, lords, bow low to him.
A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire
A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day
A field of battle between Towton and Saxton, in Yorkshire
A loud alarum. Enter CLIFFORD, wounded
A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.
A chase in the north of England
A man at least, for less I should not be;
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
A cold premeditation for my purpose!
A plain in Warwickshire
A park near Middleham Castle in Yorkshire
A salve for any sore that may betide.
A parley, sirrah, to George of Clarence.
A field of battle near Barnet
A CRIER
A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
A man may weep upon his wedding-day.
A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys  
A place next to the King.
A new hell in himself.
A most poor issue?
A thing inspir'd, and, not consulting, broke
A minister in his power. You know his nature,
A full hot horse, who being allow'd his way,
A noise within, crying 'Room for the Queen!'
A single voice; and that not pass'd me but
A trembling contribution! Why, we take  
A fit or two o' th' face; but they are shrewd ones;
A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.
A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong  
A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;
A good digestion to you all; and once more
A noble company! What are their pleasures?
A thousand thanks, and pray 'em take their pleasures.
A little happier than my wretched father;
A most unnatural and faithless service.
A strong faith to conceal it.
A buzzing of a separation
A woman of less place might ask by law-
A thousand pound a year, annual support,
A very fresh-fish here-fie, fie, fie upon
A thousand pounds a year for pure respect!  
A prince most prudent, of an excellent
A year before. It is not to be question'd  
A better wife, let him in nought be trusted
A royal lady, spake one the least word that might
A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and
A strange tongue makes my cause more strange, suspicious;
A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?
A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,
A soul as even as a calm. Pray think us
A creature of the Queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'
A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain
A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to
A loyal and obedient subject is
A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune,
A league between his Highness and Ferrara.
A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,
A peace above all earthly dignities,
A still and quiet conscience. The King has cur'd me,
A load would sink a navy-too much honour.
A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.
A street in Westminster
A distance from her, while her Grace sat down
A man in much esteem with th' King, and truly
A worthy friend. The King has made him Master
A gentleman, sent from the King, to see you.
A right good husband, let him be a noble;
A queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.
A most arch heretic, a pestilence  
A quiet night, and my good mistress will  
A man of his place, and so near our favour,
A Council table brought in, with chairs and stools, and placed
A man that more detests, more stirs against,
A shrewd turn and he's your friend for ever.'
A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.
A pattern to all princes living with her,
A most unspotted lily shall she pass
A soldier by the honour-giving hand
A half-fac'd groat five hundred pound a year!
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
A foot of honour better than I was;
A will that bars the title of thy son.
A woman's will; a cank'red grandam's will!
A peaceful progress to the ocean.
A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,
A widow, husbandless, subject to fears;
A woman, naturally born to fears;
A widow cries: Be husband to me, heavens!
A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear
A mother's curse-on her revolting son.
A chafed lion by the mortal paw,
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
A rage whose heat hath this condition
A passion hateful to my purposes;
A whole armado of convicted sail
A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,
A fearful eye thou hast; where is that blood
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
A thousand businesses are brief in hand,  
A cock'red silken wanton, brave our fields
A voluntary zeal and an unurg'd faith
A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
A Soothsayer
A Poet
A public place.
A wretched creature and must bend his body
A man of such a feeble temper should
A street. Thunder and lightning.
A man no mightier than thyself or me
A shrewd contriver; and you know his means,
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.
A woman well reputed, Cato's daughter.
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
A street near the Capitol.
A crowd of people, among them Artemidorus and the Soothsayer.
A Hail, Caesar! Read this schedule.
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
A street.
A house in Rome. Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus, seated at a table.
A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds
A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,
A little from this ground.
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
A canopy most fatal, under which
A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend.
A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe,
A Captain under Edmund's command.
A Herald.
A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
A credulous father! and a brother noble,
A little to disquantity your train,
A babe to honour her! If she must teem,  
A fox when one has caught her,
A court within the Castle of the Earl of Gloucester.
A childlike office.
A plague upon your epileptic visage!  
A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
A good man's fortune may grow out at heels.
A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle  
A heath.
A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.
A farmhouse near Gloucester's Castle.
A mistress's command. Wear this.          [Gives a favour.]
A father, and a gracious aged man,
A man, a prince, by him so benefited!  
A woman's shape doth shield thee.
A troop of horse with felt. I'll put't in proof,  
A plot upon her virtuous husband's life,
A drum afar off.
A tent in the French camp.
A field between the two camps.
A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'no,'
A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.
A FORESTER
A mild of grace and complete majesty-
A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
A man of complements, whom right and wrong
A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.
A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red.
A man of sovereign parts, peerless esteem'd,
A hundred thousand more, in surety of the which,
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast,
A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
A domineering pedant o'er the boy,
A woman, that is like a German clock,
A whitely wanton with a velvet brow,
A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.
A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
A green goose a goddess- pure, pure idolatry.
A caudle, ho!
A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,  
A leg, a limb-
A true man or a thief that gallops so?
A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
A wife of such wood were felicity.
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind.
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
A huge translation of hypocrisy,
A better speech was never spoke before.
A mean most meanly; and in ushering,
A world of torments though I should endure,
A mess of Russians left us but of late.
A man so breathed that certain he would fight ye,
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue.
A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,
A wife?
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
A Scottish Doctor
A Sergeant
A Porter
A desert place. Thunder and lightning.
A camp near Forres. Alarum within.
A heath. Thunder.
A prosperous gentleman; and to be King  
A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
A limbeck only. When in swinish sleep
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
A bell rings.
A little water clears us of this deed.
A fellow to it.
A falcon towering in her pride of place
A deed of dreadful note.
A park near the palace.
A Hall in the palace. A banquet prepared.
A woman's story at a winter's fire,
A heath. Thunder.
A cavern. In the middle, a boiling cauldron. Thunder.
A show of eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand;
A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
A stanchless avarice that, were I King,
A most miraculous work in this good King,
A modern ecstasy. The dead man's knell
A cry of women within.
A JUSTICE
A pow'r I have, but of what strength and nature
A street
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
A monastery
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
A nunnery
A novice of this place, and the fair sister
A warrant for his execution.
A hall in ANGELO'S house
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
A prison
A man already made, as to remit
A merriment than a vice.
A pond as deep as hell.
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
A word of this. What ho, within! come forth.  
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
A league below the city; and from thence,
A street near the city gate
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then  
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
A very scurvy fellow.  
A marble monument!
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds
A stage, where every man must play a part,
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
A breed for barren metal of his friend?-
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.                  Exit
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
A coin that bears the figure of an angel  
A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
A vessel of our country richly fraught.
A young Venetian, one that comes before
A day in April never came so sweet
A SONG
A golden mesh t' entrap the hearts of men
A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich,
A creature that did bear the shape of man
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
A many fools that stand in better place,
A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
A losing suit against him. Are you answered?
A messenger with letters from the doctor,
A young and learned doctor to our court.
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
A substitute shines brightly as a king
A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy
A prating boy that begg'd it as a fee;
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
A room in the Garter Inn
A field near Windsor
A field near Frogmore
A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.
A street leading to the Park
A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
A wood near Athens
A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king.
A merrier hour was never wasted there.
A sweet Athenian lady is in love
A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
A million fail, confounding oath on oath.
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.
A weak bond holds you; I'll not trust your word.
A local habitation and a name.
A lion fell, nor else no lion's dam;
A fortnight hold we this solemnity,
A Sexton.
A Boy.
A room in Leonato's house.
A hall in Leonato's house.
A hall in Leonato's house.
A room in Leonato's house.
A street.
A Room in Leonato's house.
A church.
A thousand times in secret.
A thousand blushing apparitions
A sin of perjury: she not denies it.
A prison.
A third is fled--that had a hand in it.
A churchyard.
A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
A Clown in service to Othello
A council chamber. The Duke and Senators sitting at a table;
A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.
A natural and prompt alacrity
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
A man he is of honesty and trust.  
A seaport in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.
A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements.
A Veronesa. Michael Cassio,
A cry within, "A sail, a sail, a sail!"
A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
A cry within, "A sail, a sail!" Guns heard.
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,
A street.
A hall in the castle.
A soldier's a man;
A cry within, "Help, help!"
A bell rings.
A Florentine more kind and honest.
A room in the castle.
A man that languishes in your displeasure.
A stranger to thy thoughts.
A sequester from liberty, fasting, and prayer,
A frank one.
A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
A passion most unsuiting such a man-
A housewife that by selling her desires
A room in the castle.
A closet lock and key of villainous secrets.
A drop of patience; but, alas, to make me
A fixed figure for the time of scorn
A bedchamber in the castle. Desdemona in bed asleep; a light burning.
A murther, which I thought a sacrifice.
A thousand times committed. Cassio confess'd it,
A better never did itself sustain
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;
A recreant and most degenerate traitor;
A jewel in a ten-times barr'd-up chest
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
A traitor to my God, my King, and me.
A loyal, just, and upright gentleman.  
A traitor to his God, his King, and him;
A long flourish, while the KING consults his Council
A dearer merit, not so deep a maim
A partial slander sought I to avoid,
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,
A parasite, a keeper-back of death,
A banish'd traitor. All my treasury
A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
A camp in Wales
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
A glorious angel. Then, if angels fight,
A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.
A little little grave, an obscure grave-
A brittle glory shineth in this face;
A plot shall show us all a merry day.                 Exeunt
A twofold marriage-'twixt my crown and me,
A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.
A beggar begs that never begg'd before.
A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
A YOUNG SON OF CLARENCE (Edward, Earl of Warwick)
A YOUNG DAUGHTER OF CLARENCE (Margaret Plantagenet,
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman-
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
A plague upon you all! His royal Grace-
A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too.
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
A liberal rewarder of his friends;
A husband and a son thou ow'st to me;
A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon,
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
A begging prince what beggar pities not?
A sennet.
A knot you are of damned blood-suckers.
A care-craz'd mother to a many sons,
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
A happy and a joyful time of day!
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
A king!-perhaps-
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
A dire induction am I witness to,
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death.
A mother only mock'd with two fair babes,
A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag
A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble,
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
A grievous burden was thy birth to me;
A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave
A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
A grandam's name is little less in love
A royal battle might be won and lost.
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
A base foul stone, made precious by the foil
A black day will it be to somebody.
A thing devised by the enemy.
A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
A scum of Britaines, and base lackey peasants,
A milk-sop, one that never in his life  
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!             Exeunt  
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.  
A Street.
A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;
A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.
A street.
A visor for a visor! What care I
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
A villain, that is hither come in spite
A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
A street.
A lover may bestride the gossamer
A public place.
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
A gentleman of princely parentage,
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.  
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
A precious ring- a ring that I must use
A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
A lightning before death. O, how may I
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
A greater power than we can contradict
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
A LORD
A PEDANT
A WIDOW
A most delicious banquet by his bed,
A bedchamber in the LORD'S house
A flourish of trumpets announces the play
A course of learning and ingenious studies.
A merchant of great traffic through the world,
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
A man well known throughout all Italy.
A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack,
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
A horse and a man
A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
A merchant of incomparable wealth.
A velvet dish. Fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy;
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap.
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie;
A public road
A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled-
A ship at sea; afterwards an uninhabited island
A time before we came unto this cell?
A prince of power.
A falsehood, in its contrary as great
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
A treacherous army levied, one midnight
A mark so bloody on the business; but
A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg'd,
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
A most auspicious star, whose influence
A dozen years; within which space she died,
A freckl'd whelp, hag-born-not honour'd with
A human shape.
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows,
A thing divine; for nothing natural
A matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,  
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king-
A contract of true love; be not too late.  
A noise of hunters beard. Enter divers SPIRITS, in
A solemn air, and the best comforter
A hearty welcome.
A vision of the island, one dear son
A heaviness that's gone.

A FOOL
A thousand moral paintings I can show
A gentleman that well deserves a help,
A room of state in TIMON'S house
A SENATOR'S house
A visage of demand; for I do fear,
A thousand talents to me.
A public place
A hall in TIMON'S house
A moderate table.
A banqueting hall in TIMON'S house
A dedicated beggar to the air,
A pox of wrinkles!
A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'st
A stone by thee.                     [Throws a stone at him]
A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal
A CAPTAIN
A MESSENGER
A CLOWN
A NURSE, and a black CHILD
A special party, have by common voice
A nobler man, a braver warrior,
A mother's tears in passion for her son;
A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;
A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.
A father and a friend to thee and Rome.
A Roman now adopted happily,
A speedier course than ling'ring languishment
A forest near Rome
A lonely part of the forest
A very excellent piece of villainy.
A barren detested vale you see it is:
A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
A very fatal place it seems to me.
A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints;
A precious ring that lightens all this hole,
A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
A stone is soft as wax: tribunes more hard than stones.
A stone is silent and offendeth not,
A banquet.
A deed of death done on the innocent
A joyful issue.
A long-tongu'd babbling gossip? No, lords, no.
A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?
A halter, soldiers! Hang him on this tree,
A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam.
A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant  
A ROMAN. You sad Andronici, have done with woes;
A Prologue arm'd, but not in confidence
A lord of Troyan blood, nephew to Hector;
A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
A stranger to those most imperial looks
A prince called Hector-Priam is his father-
A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
A form of strangeness as we pass along.  
A very horse that has he knows not what!  
A great-siz'd monster of ingratitudes.
A woman impudent and mannish grown
A labour sav'd!
A thousand complete courses of the sun!
A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple  
A Troyan hath been slain; since she could speak,
A priest, there off'ring to it his own heart.                Exit
A victor shall be known? Will you the knights
A little proudly, and great deal misprizing
A second hope as fairly built as Hector.
A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;
A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
A great addition earned in thy death.
A thought of added honour torn from Hector.
A drop of Grecian blood. The end crowns all;
A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?
A token from her daughter, my fair love,
A guard of patience. Stay a little while.
A SEA CAPTAIN, friend of Viola
A city in Illyria; and the sea-coast near it
A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh  
A gracious person; but yet I cannot love him.
A street
A stoup of wine, Maria!
A thousand thousand to save,
A ring in chase of you; so did I abuse
A murd'rous guilt shows not itself more soon
A street
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.           Exit
A baubling vessel was he captain of,
A natural perspective, that is and is not.
A gentleman and follower of my lady's.
A most extracting frenzy of mine own
A solemn combination shall be made
A foolish thing was but a toy,
A great while ago the world begun,
A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had buried her grandam;
A journey to my loving Proteus.
A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears,
A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,
A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears;
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,
A man I am cross'd with adversity;
A linguist, and a man of such perfection
A slave that still an end turns me to shame!  
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful!
A smaller boon than this I cannot beg,
A MARINER
A GAOLER
A servant grafted in my serious trust,
A lip of much contempt, speeds from me;
A party in this alteration, finding
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril  
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
A federary with her, and one that knows
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
A school-boy's top. Away with her to prison.
A thriving issue; there is no lady living
A man, the worst about you.
A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door!
A most intelligencing bawd!
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence,
A just and open trial. While she lives,
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
A moiety of the throne, a great king's daughter,
A lady like me; with a love even such,
A lullaby too rough; I never saw
A merry heart goes all the day,
A ram and bleated; and the fire-rob'd god,
A way to make us better friends, more known.
A fair one are you- well you fit our ages
A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
A wave o' th' sea, that you might ever do
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepar'd
A place whereto you'll go?
A great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking on's teeth.
A saint-like sorrow. No fault could you make
A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
A graceful gentleman, against whose person,
A shepherd's daughter.
A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far-
A LOVER'S COMPLAINT
A plaintful story from a sist'ring vale,
A thousand favours from a maund she drew  
A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh,
A youthful suit- it was to gain my grace-
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted
A man in hue all hues in his controlling,
A dearer birth than this his love had brought
A loss in love that touches me more nearly.  
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,
A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
A third nor red, nor white, had stol'n of both,
A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
A god in love, to whom I am confined.
A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe,
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face,
A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
A dateless lively heat still to endure,

A WIDOW OF FLORENCE.
A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,
A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,
A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;  
A braving war.
A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
A native slip to us from foreign seeds.
A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
A senseless help, when help past sense we deem.
A modest one to bear me back again.
A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame,
A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
A poor physician's daughter-thou dislik'st
A lying trophy; and as oft is dumb
A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
A balance more replete.
A young man married is a man that's marr'd.
A very serious business calls on him.
A charge too heavy for my strength; but yet
A lover of thy drum, hater of love.                   Exeunt
A tucket afar off. Enter an old WIDOW OF FLORENCE, her daughter DIANA,
A shrewd turn, if she pleas'd.
A wife of me, though there my hope be done.
A stranger, no offender; and inform him
A SOOTHSAYER
A CLOWN
A little I can read.
A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
A man who is the abstract of all faults
A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
A space for farther travel.
A better ear. Menas, I did not think
A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense  
A blessed lottery to him.
A meaner than myself; since I myself
A cistern for scal'd snakes! Go, get thee hence.
A sennet sounded. Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS,
A plain in Syria
A statue than a breather.
A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented
A soldier and his horse.
A plain near Actium
A most unnoble swerving.
A private man in Athens. This for him.
A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
A diminution in our captain's brain
A mangled shadow. Perchance to-morrow
A workman in't.
A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
A shrewd one to's.
A master-leaver and a fugitive!
A hill near Alexandria
A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
A forked mountain, or blue promontory
A million moe, now lost- she, Eros, has
A nobleness in record. But I will be
A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
A greater crack. The round world
A moiety of the world.
A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar:
A minister of her will; and it is great
A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly
A sun and moon, which kept their course and lighted
A benefit in this change; but if you seek
A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
A pair so famous. High events as these
A person representing HYMEN
A lawn before the DUKE'S palace
A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
A boar spear in my hand; and- in my heart
A thievish living on the common road?
A stubborn will to please,
A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and LORDS, like outlaws
A motley fool. A miserable world!  
A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
A scatt'red smile, and that I'll live upon.
A little riper and more lusty red
A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,
A sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?
A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,
A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
A COURTEZAN
A hall in the DUKE'S palace
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
A mean woman was delivered
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
A man is master of his liberty;
A wretched soul, bruis'd with adversity,
A sunny look of his would soon repair.
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish.
A vulgar comment will be made of it,
A husband's office? Shall, Antipholus,
A public place
A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;
A wolf, nay worse, a fellow all in buff;
A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands
A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dry-foot well;
A chain, a chain. Do you not hear it ring?
A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
A nut, a cherry-stone;
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
A street
A street before a priory
A sin prevailing much in youthful men
A charitable duty of my order;
A most outrageous fit of madness took him,
A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,
A needy, hollow-ey'd, sharp-looking wretch,
A living dead man. This pernicious slave,

A CITIZEN of Antium  
A pretty tale. It may be you have heard it;
A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
A place below the first; for what miscarries
A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
A field of battle between the Roman and the Volscian camps
A bribe to pay my sword. I do refuse it,
A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius, Marcius!'
A flourish. Cornets. Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS bloody, with two or three soldiers
A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the

A sure destruction.
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
A sennet. Enter the PATRICIANS and the TRIBUNES
A little of that worthy work perform'd
A kinder value of the people than
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
A place of potency and sway o' th' state,
A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labour'd,
A man of their infirmity.
A noble life before a long, and wish
A foe to th' public weal. Obey, I charge thee,
A brand to th' end o' th' world.
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't;
A most inherent baseness.
A noble cunning. You were us'd to load me
A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
A highway between Rome and Antium
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter

A mother less, or granted less, Aufidius?
A better witness back than words, which we,
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
A city full; of tribunes such as you,
A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
A good construction. I rais'd him, and I pawn'd

A sample to the youngest; to th' more mature
A glass that feated them; and to the graver
A child that guided dotards. To his mistress,
A year's age on me!
A seat for baseness.
A lustre to it.
A man worth any woman; overbuys me
A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
A drop of blood a day and, being aged,
A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect
A sly and constant knave,
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady
A Gallian girl at home. He furnaces
A saucy stranger in his court to mart  
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer  
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,
A pantler- not so eminent!
A second night of such sweet shortness which  
A pudency so rosy, the sweet view on't
A world by itself, and we will nothing pay
A riding suit, no costlier than would fit
A franklin's huswife.
A cell of ignorance, travelling abed,
A prison for a debtor that not dares
A pain that only seems to seek out danger
A storm, or robbery, call it what you will,
A look untender! If't be summer news,
A little witness my obedience. Look!
A strain of rareness; and I grieve myself
A man already.

A conduct overland to Milford Haven.
A thing more made of malice than of duty;

A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,
A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
A law-breaker, a villain. Yield thee, thief.
A headless man? The garments of Posthumus?
A very valiant Briton and a good,
A grave. Come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd
A fever with the absence of her son;
A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,
A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel
A very drudge of nature's, have subdu'd me
A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,  
A stop i' th' chaser, a retire; anon
A rout, confusion thick. Forthwith they fly,
A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.
A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again
A thing of pity.
A father to me; and thou hast created
A mother and two brothers. But, O scorn,
A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer.
A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,
A shop of all the qualities that man
A sacrilegious thief, to do't. The temple
A precious thing! I had it from the Queen.
A certain stuff, which, being ta'en would cease
A banish'd traitor.
A pair of worthier sons.
A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother

A Gentleman, courtier.
A Priest.
A Norwegian Captain.
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
A sable silver'd.

A double blessing is a double grace;

A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
A couch for luxury and damned incest.

A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,

A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
A scullion!  
A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
A second time I kill my husband dead
A very, very- pajock.
A room in the Castle.
A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
A villain kills my father; and for that,
A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
A station like the herald Mercury
A combination and a form indeed
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
A noise within.
A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
A face without a heart,'
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
A very noble youth. Mark.
A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
A table and flagons of wine on it.

A pouncet box, which ever and anon
A plague upon it! it is in GIoucestershire-  
A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed,
A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
A gross fat man.
A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.
A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
A virtue that was never seen in you.
A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,
A couching lion and a ramping cat,
A good mouth-filling oath; and leave 'in sooth'
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
A mighty and a fearful head they are,
A comfort of retirement lives in this.
A larger dare to our great enterprise,
A public road near Coventry.
A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
A prodigy of fear, and a portent
A hare-brained Hotspur govern'd by a spleen.
A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,
A sword whose temper I intend to stain
A second time do such a courtesy.
A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;
A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear:
A very valiant rebel of the name.  
A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
A retreat is sounded.
A noble earl, and many a creature else
A gentleman well bred and of good name,
A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,
A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,
A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
A naked subject to the weeping clouds
A dozen captains stay at door for you.
A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?  
A certain instance that Glendower is dead.
A rotten case abides no handling.
A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,
A ragged and forestall'd remission.
A cup of wine, sir?
A cup of wine that's brisk and fine,
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,
A hundred alms-houses right well supplied;
A thousand pounds by th' year: thus runs the bill.
A fearful battle rend'red you in music.
A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'
A little cloth.
A night is but small breath and little pause
A city on th' inconstant billows dancing;
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,
A damned death!
A largess universal, like the sun,
A little touch of Harry in the night.
A good soft pillow for that good white head  
A lad of life, an imp of fame;
A very little little let us do,
A many of our bodies shall no doubt
A testament of noble-ending love.
A LAWYER
A FRENCH SERGEANT
A PORTER
A far more glorious star thy soul will make
A third thinks, without expense at all,
A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,
A holy maid hither with me I bring,
A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have plac'd;
A holy prophetess new risen up,
A woman clad in armour chaseth them.
A witch by fear, not force, like Hannibal,
A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear
A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd;
A second Hector, for his grim aspect
A thousand souls to death and deadly night.
A man of thy profession and degree;
A prophet to the fall of all our foes!
A braver soldier never couched lance,
A gentler heart did never sway in court;
A stouter champion never handled sword.
A letter was deliver'd to my hands,
A little herd of England's timorous deer,
A terrible and unavoided danger;
A field of battle
A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.
A man of great authority in France,
A goodly prize, fit for the devil's grace!
A virgin, and his servant, say to him.
A virgin from her tender infancy,
A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
A LIEUTENANT, a SHIPMASTER, a MASTER'S MATE, and WALTER WHITMORE  
A SPIRIT raised by him
A world of earthly blessings to my soul,
A day will come when York shall claim his own;
A spirit rais'd from depth of underground
A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!
A sorry breakfast for my Lord Protector.
A man that ne'er saw in his life before.
A hundred times and oft'ner, in my sleep,
A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,
A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.
A heart it was, bound in with diamonds-
A wilderness is populous enough,
A cunning man did calculate my birth  
A Roman sworder and banditto slave
A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul
A poor esquire of Kent that loves his king.
A NOBLEMAN                         TWO KEEPERS
A HUNTSMAN
A SON that has killed his father
A FATHER that has killed his son
A woman's general; what should we fear?  
A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'  
A bird that will revenge upon you all;
A crown for York!-and, lords, bow low to him.
A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire
A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day
A field of battle between Towton and Saxton, in Yorkshire
A loud alarum. Enter CLIFFORD, wounded
A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.
A chase in the north of England
A man at least, for less I should not be;
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
A cold premeditation for my purpose!
A plain in Warwickshire
A park near Middleham Castle in Yorkshire
A salve for any sore that may betide.
A parley, sirrah, to George of Clarence.
A field of battle near Barnet
A CRIER
A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
A man may weep upon his wedding-day.
A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys  
A place next to the King.
A new hell in himself.
A most poor issue?
A thing inspir'd, and, not consulting, broke
A minister in his power. You know his nature,
A full hot horse, who being allow'd his way,
A noise within, crying 'Room for the Queen!'
A single voice; and that not pass'd me but
A trembling contribution! Why, we take  
A fit or two o' th' face; but they are shrewd ones;
A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.
A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong  
A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;
A good digestion to you all; and once more
A noble company! What are their pleasures?
A thousand thanks, and pray 'em take their pleasures.
A little happier than my wretched father;
A most unnatural and faithless service.
A strong faith to conceal it.
A buzzing of a separation
A woman of less place might ask by law-
A thousand pound a year, annual support,
A very fresh-fish here-fie, fie, fie upon
A thousand pounds a year for pure respect!  
A prince most prudent, of an excellent
A year before. It is not to be question'd  
A better wife, let him in nought be trusted
A royal lady, spake one the least word that might
A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and
A strange tongue makes my cause more strange, suspicious;
A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?
A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,
A soul as even as a calm. Pray think us
A creature of the Queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'
A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain
A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to
A loyal and obedient subject is
A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune,
A league between his Highness and Ferrara.
A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,
A peace above all earthly dignities,
A still and quiet conscience. The King has cur'd me,
A load would sink a navy-too much honour.
A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.
A street in Westminster
A distance from her, while her Grace sat down
A man in much esteem with th' King, and truly
A worthy friend. The King has made him Master
A gentleman, sent from the King, to see you.
A right good husband, let him be a noble;
A queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.
A most arch heretic, a pestilence  
A quiet night, and my good mistress will  
A man of his place, and so near our favour,
A Council table brought in, with chairs and stools, and placed
A man that more detests, more stirs against,
A shrewd turn and he's your friend for ever.'
A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.
A pattern to all princes living with her,
A most unspotted lily shall she pass
A soldier by the honour-giving hand
A half-fac'd groat five hundred pound a year!
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
A foot of honour better than I was;
A will that bars the title of thy son.
A woman's will; a cank'red grandam's will!
A peaceful progress to the ocean.
A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,
A widow, husbandless, subject to fears;
A woman, naturally born to fears;
A widow cries: Be husband to me, heavens!
A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear
A mother's curse-on her revolting son.
A chafed lion by the mortal paw,
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
A rage whose heat hath this condition
A passion hateful to my purposes;
A whole armado of convicted sail
A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,
A fearful eye thou hast; where is that blood
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
A thousand businesses are brief in hand,  
A cock'red silken wanton, brave our fields
A voluntary zeal and an unurg'd faith
A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
A Soothsayer
A Poet
A public place.
A wretched creature and must bend his body
A man of such a feeble temper should
A street. Thunder and lightning.
A man no mightier than thyself or me
A shrewd contriver; and you know his means,
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.
A woman well reputed, Cato's daughter.
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
A street near the Capitol.
A crowd of people, among them Artemidorus and the Soothsayer.
A Hail, Caesar! Read this schedule.
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
A street.
A house in Rome. Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus, seated at a table.
A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds
A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,
A little from this ground.
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
A canopy most fatal, under which
A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend.
A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe,
A Captain under Edmund's command.
A Herald.
A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
A credulous father! and a brother noble,
A little to disquantity your train,
A babe to honour her! If she must teem,  
A fox when one has caught her,
A court within the Castle of the Earl of Gloucester.
A childlike office.
A plague upon your epileptic visage!  
A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
A good man's fortune may grow out at heels.
A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle  
A heath.
A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.
A farmhouse near Gloucester's Castle.
A mistress's command. Wear this.          [Gives a favour.]
A father, and a gracious aged man,
A man, a prince, by him so benefited!  
A woman's shape doth shield thee.
A troop of horse with felt. I'll put't in proof,  
A plot upon her virtuous husband's life,
A drum afar off.
A tent in the French camp.
A field between the two camps.
A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'no,'
A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.
A FORESTER
A mild of grace and complete majesty-
A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
A man of complements, whom right and wrong
A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.
A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red.
A man of sovereign parts, peerless esteem'd,
A hundred thousand more, in surety of the which,
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast,
A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
A domineering pedant o'er the boy,
A woman, that is like a German clock,
A whitely wanton with a velvet brow,
A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.
A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
A green goose a goddess- pure, pure idolatry.
A caudle, ho!
A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,  
A leg, a limb-
A true man or a thief that gallops so?
A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
A wife of such wood were felicity.
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind.
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
A huge translation of hypocrisy,
A better speech was never spoke before.
A mean most meanly; and in ushering,
A world of torments though I should endure,
A mess of Russians left us but of late.
A man so breathed that certain he would fight ye,
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue.
A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,
A wife?
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
A Scottish Doctor
A Sergeant
A Porter
A desert place. Thunder and lightning.
A camp near Forres. Alarum within.
A heath. Thunder.
A prosperous gentleman; and to be King  
A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
A limbeck only. When in swinish sleep
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
A bell rings.
A little water clears us of this deed.
A fellow to it.
A falcon towering in her pride of place
A deed of dreadful note.
A park near the palace.
A Hall in the palace. A banquet prepared.
A woman's story at a winter's fire,
A heath. Thunder.
A cavern. In the middle, a boiling cauldron. Thunder.
A show of eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand;
A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
A stanchless avarice that, were I King,
A most miraculous work in this good King,
A modern ecstasy. The dead man's knell
A cry of women within.
A JUSTICE
A pow'r I have, but of what strength and nature
A street
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
A monastery
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
A nunnery
A novice of this place, and the fair sister
A warrant for his execution.
A hall in ANGELO'S house
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
A prison
A man already made, as to remit
A merriment than a vice.
A pond as deep as hell.
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
A word of this. What ho, within! come forth.  
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
A league below the city; and from thence,
A street near the city gate
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then  
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
A very scurvy fellow.  
A marble monument!
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds
A stage, where every man must play a part,
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
A breed for barren metal of his friend?-
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.                  Exit
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
A coin that bears the figure of an angel  
A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
A vessel of our country richly fraught.
A young Venetian, one that comes before
A day in April never came so sweet
A SONG
A golden mesh t' entrap the hearts of men
A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich,
A creature that did bear the shape of man
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
A many fools that stand in better place,
A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
A losing suit against him. Are you answered?
A messenger with letters from the doctor,
A young and learned doctor to our court.
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
A substitute shines brightly as a king
A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy
A prating boy that begg'd it as a fee;
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
A room in the Garter Inn
A field near Windsor
A field near Frogmore
A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.
A street leading to the Park
A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
A wood near Athens
A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king.
A merrier hour was never wasted there.
A sweet Athenian lady is in love
A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
A million fail, confounding oath on oath.
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.
A weak bond holds you; I'll not trust your word.
A local habitation and a name.
A lion fell, nor else no lion's dam;
A fortnight hold we this solemnity,
A Sexton.
A Boy.
A room in Leonato's house.
A hall in Leonato's house.
A hall in Leonato's house.
A room in Leonato's house.
A street.
A Room in Leonato's house.
A church.
A thousand times in secret.
A thousand blushing apparitions
A sin of perjury: she not denies it.
A prison.
A third is fled--that had a hand in it.
A churchyard.
A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
A Clown in service to Othello
A council chamber. The Duke and Senators sitting at a table;
A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.
A natural and prompt alacrity
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
A man he is of honesty and trust.  
A seaport in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.
A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements.
A Veronesa. Michael Cassio,
A cry within, "A sail, a sail, a sail!"
A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
A cry within, "A sail, a sail!" Guns heard.
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,
A street.
A hall in the castle.
A soldier's a man;
A cry within, "Help, help!"
A bell rings.
A Florentine more kind and honest.
A room in the castle.
A man that languishes in your displeasure.
A stranger to thy thoughts.
A sequester from liberty, fasting, and prayer,
A frank one.
A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
A passion most unsuiting such a man-
A housewife that by selling her desires
A room in the castle.
A closet lock and key of villainous secrets.
A drop of patience; but, alas, to make me
A fixed figure for the time of scorn
A bedchamber in the castle. Desdemona in bed asleep; a light burning.
A murther, which I thought a sacrifice.
A thousand times committed. Cassio confess'd it,
A better never did itself sustain
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;
A recreant and most degenerate traitor;
A jewel in a ten-times barr'd-up chest
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
A traitor to my God, my King, and me.
A loyal, just, and upright gentleman.  
A traitor to his God, his King, and him;
A long flourish, while the KING consults his Council
A dearer merit, not so deep a maim
A partial slander sought I to avoid,
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,
A parasite, a keeper-back of death,
A banish'd traitor. All my treasury
A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
A camp in Wales
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
A glorious angel. Then, if angels fight,
A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.
A little little grave, an obscure grave-
A brittle glory shineth in this face;
A plot shall show us all a merry day.                 Exeunt
A twofold marriage-'twixt my crown and me,
A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.
A beggar begs that never begg'd before.
A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
A YOUNG SON OF CLARENCE (Edward, Earl of Warwick)
A YOUNG DAUGHTER OF CLARENCE (Margaret Plantagenet,
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman-
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
A plague upon you all! His royal Grace-
A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too.
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
A liberal rewarder of his friends;
A husband and a son thou ow'st to me;
A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon,
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
A begging prince what beggar pities not?
A sennet.
A knot you are of damned blood-suckers.
A care-craz'd mother to a many sons,
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
A happy and a joyful time of day!
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
A king!-perhaps-
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
A dire induction am I witness to,
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death.
A mother only mock'd with two fair babes,
A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag
A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble,
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
A grievous burden was thy birth to me;
A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave
A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
A grandam's name is little less in love
A royal battle might be won and lost.
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
A base foul stone, made precious by the foil
A black day will it be to somebody.
A thing devised by the enemy.
A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
A scum of Britaines, and base lackey peasants,
A milk-sop, one that never in his life  
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!             Exeunt  
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.  
A Street.
A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;
A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.
A street.
A visor for a visor! What care I
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
A villain, that is hither come in spite
A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
A street.
A lover may bestride the gossamer
A public place.
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
A gentleman of princely parentage,
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.  
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
A precious ring- a ring that I must use
A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
A lightning before death. O, how may I
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
A greater power than we can contradict
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
A LORD
A PEDANT
A WIDOW
A most delicious banquet by his bed,
A bedchamber in the LORD'S house
A flourish of trumpets announces the play
A course of learning and ingenious studies.
A merchant of great traffic through the world,
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
A man well known throughout all Italy.
A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack,
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
A horse and a man
A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
A merchant of incomparable wealth.
A velvet dish. Fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy;
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap.
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie;
A public road
A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled-
A ship at sea; afterwards an uninhabited island
A time before we came unto this cell?
A prince of power.
A falsehood, in its contrary as great
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
A treacherous army levied, one midnight
A mark so bloody on the business; but
A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg'd,
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
A most auspicious star, whose influence
A dozen years; within which space she died,
A freckl'd whelp, hag-born-not honour'd with
A human shape.
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows,
A thing divine; for nothing natural
A matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,  
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king-
A contract of true love; be not too late.  
A noise of hunters beard. Enter divers SPIRITS, in
A solemn air, and the best comforter
A hearty welcome.
A vision of the island, one dear son
A heaviness that's gone.
A PAGE
A FOOL
A thousand moral paintings I can show
A gentleman that well deserves a help,
A room of state in TIMON'S house
A SENATOR'S house
A visage of demand; for I do fear,
A thousand talents to me.
A public place
A hall in TIMON'S house
A moderate table.
A banqueting hall in TIMON'S house
A dedicated beggar to the air,
A pox of wrinkles!
A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'st
A stone by thee.                     [Throws a stone at him]
A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal
A CAPTAIN
A MESSENGER
A CLOWN
A NURSE, and a black CHILD
A special party, have by common voice
A nobler man, a braver warrior,
A mother's tears in passion for her son;
A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;
A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.
A father and a friend to thee and Rome.
A Roman now adopted happily,
A speedier course than ling'ring languishment
A forest near Rome
A lonely part of the forest
A very excellent piece of villainy.
A barren detested vale you see it is:
A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
A very fatal place it seems to me.
A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints;
A precious ring that lightens all this hole,
A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
A stone is soft as wax: tribunes more hard than stones.
A stone is silent and offendeth not,
A banquet.
A deed of death done on the innocent
A joyful issue.
A long-tongu'd babbling gossip? No, lords, no.
A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?
A halter, soldiers! Hang him on this tree,
A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam.
A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant  
A ROMAN. You sad Andronici, have done with woes;
A Prologue arm'd, but not in confidence
A lord of Troyan blood, nephew to Hector;
A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
A stranger to those most imperial looks
A prince called Hector-Priam is his father-
A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
A form of strangeness as we pass along.  
A very horse that has he knows not what!  
A great-siz'd monster of ingratitudes.
A woman impudent and mannish grown
A labour sav'd!
A thousand complete courses of the sun!
A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple  
A Troyan hath been slain; since she could speak,
A priest, there off'ring to it his own heart.                Exit
A victor shall be known? Will you the knights
A little proudly, and great deal misprizing
A second hope as fairly built as Hector.
A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;
A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
A great addition earned in thy death.
A thought of added honour torn from Hector.
A drop of Grecian blood. The end crowns all;
A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?
A token from her daughter, my fair love,
A guard of patience. Stay a little while.
A SEA CAPTAIN, friend of Viola
A city in Illyria; and the sea-coast near it
A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh  
A gracious person; but yet I cannot love him.
A street
A stoup of wine, Maria!
A thousand thousand to save,
A ring in chase of you; so did I abuse
A murd'rous guilt shows not itself more soon
A street
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.           Exit
A baubling vessel was he captain of,
A natural perspective, that is and is not.
A gentleman and follower of my lady's.
A most extracting frenzy of mine own
A solemn combination shall be made
A foolish thing was but a toy,
A great while ago the world begun,
A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had buried her grandam;
A journey to my loving Proteus.
A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears,
A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,
A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears;
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,
A man I am cross'd with adversity;
A linguist, and a man of such perfection
A slave that still an end turns me to shame!  
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful!
A smaller boon than this I cannot beg,
A MARINER
A GAOLER
A servant grafted in my serious trust,
A lip of much contempt, speeds from me;
A party in this alteration, finding
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril  
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
A federary with her, and one that knows
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
A school-boy's top. Away with her to prison.
A thriving issue; there is no lady living
A man, the worst about you.
A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door!
A most intelligencing bawd!
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence,
A just and open trial. While she lives,
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
A moiety of the throne, a great king's daughter,
A lady like me; with a love even such,
A lullaby too rough; I never saw
A merry heart goes all the day,
A ram and bleated; and the fire-rob'd god,
A way to make us better friends, more known.
A fair one are you- well you fit our ages
A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
A wave o' th' sea, that you might ever do
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepar'd
A place whereto you'll go?
A great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking on's teeth.
A saint-like sorrow. No fault could you make
A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
A graceful gentleman, against whose person,
A shepherd's daughter.
A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far-
A LOVER'S COMPLAINT
A plaintful story from a sist'ring vale,
A thousand favours from a maund she drew  
A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh,
A youthful suit- it was to gain my grace-
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted
A man in hue all hues in his controlling,
A dearer birth than this his love had brought
A loss in love that touches me more nearly.  
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,
A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
A third nor red, nor white, had stol'n of both,
A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
A god in love, to whom I am confined.
A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe,
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face,
A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
A dateless lively heat still to endure,
A PAGE, Servant to the Countess of Rousillon
A WIDOW OF FLORENCE.
A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,
A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,
A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;  
A braving war.
A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
A native slip to us from foreign seeds.
A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
A senseless help, when help past sense we deem.
A modest one to bear me back again.
A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame,
A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
A poor physician's daughter-thou dislik'st
A lying trophy; and as oft is dumb
A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
A balance more replete.
A young man married is a man that's marr'd.
A very serious business calls on him.
A charge too heavy for my strength; but yet
A lover of thy drum, hater of love.                   Exeunt
A tucket afar off. Enter an old WIDOW OF FLORENCE, her daughter DIANA,
A shrewd turn, if she pleas'd.
A wife of me, though there my hope be done.
A stranger, no offender; and inform him
A SOOTHSAYER
A CLOWN
A little I can read.
A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
A man who is the abstract of all faults
A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
A space for farther travel.
A better ear. Menas, I did not think
A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense  
A blessed lottery to him.
A meaner than myself; since I myself
A cistern for scal'd snakes! Go, get thee hence.
A sennet sounded. Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS,
A plain in Syria
A statue than a breather.
A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented
A soldier and his horse.
A plain near Actium
A most unnoble swerving.
A private man in Athens. This for him.
A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
A diminution in our captain's brain
A mangled shadow. Perchance to-morrow
A workman in't.
A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
A shrewd one to's.
A master-leaver and a fugitive!
A hill near Alexandria
A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
A forked mountain, or blue promontory
A million moe, now lost- she, Eros, has
A nobleness in record. But I will be
A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
A greater crack. The round world
A moiety of the world.
A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar:
A minister of her will; and it is great
A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly
A sun and moon, which kept their course and lighted
A benefit in this change; but if you seek
A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
A pair so famous. High events as these
A person representing HYMEN
A lawn before the DUKE'S palace
A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
A boar spear in my hand; and- in my heart
A thievish living on the common road?
A stubborn will to please,
A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and LORDS, like outlaws
A motley fool. A miserable world!  
A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
A scatt'red smile, and that I'll live upon.
A little riper and more lusty red
A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,
A sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?
A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,
A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
A COURTEZAN
A hall in the DUKE'S palace
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
A mean woman was delivered
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
A man is master of his liberty;
A wretched soul, bruis'd with adversity,
A sunny look of his would soon repair.
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish.
A vulgar comment will be made of it,
A husband's office? Shall, Antipholus,
A public place
A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;
A wolf, nay worse, a fellow all in buff;
A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands
A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dry-foot well;
A chain, a chain. Do you not hear it ring?
A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
A nut, a cherry-stone;
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
A street
A street before a priory
A sin prevailing much in youthful men
A charitable duty of my order;
A most outrageous fit of madness took him,
A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,
A needy, hollow-ey'd, sharp-looking wretch,
A living dead man. This pernicious slave,
A ROMAN HERALD
A CITIZEN of Antium  
A pretty tale. It may be you have heard it;
A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
A place below the first; for what miscarries
A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
A field of battle between the Roman and the Volscian camps
A bribe to pay my sword. I do refuse it,
A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius, Marcius!'
A flourish. Cornets. Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS bloody, with two or three soldiers
A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the
A curse begin at very root on's heart
A sure destruction.
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
A sennet. Enter the PATRICIANS and the TRIBUNES
A little of that worthy work perform'd
A kinder value of the people than
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
A place of potency and sway o' th' state,
A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labour'd,
A man of their infirmity.
A noble life before a long, and wish
A foe to th' public weal. Obey, I charge thee,
A brand to th' end o' th' world.
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't;
A most inherent baseness.
A noble cunning. You were us'd to load me
A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
A highway between Rome and Antium
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
A worthy officer i' the war, but insolent,
A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
A camp at a short distance from Rome
A noble servant to them, but he could not
A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
A pair of tribunes that have wrack'd for Rome
A private whisper- no, not with such friends
A mother less, or granted less, Aufidius?
A better witness back than words, which we,
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
A city full; of tribunes such as you,
A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
A good construction. I rais'd him, and I pawn'd
A twist of rotten silk; never admitting
A FRENCH GENTLEMAN, friend to Philario
A ROMAN CAPTAIN
A sample to the youngest; to th' more mature
A glass that feated them; and to the graver
A child that guided dotards. To his mistress,
A year's age on me!
A seat for baseness.
A lustre to it.
A man worth any woman; overbuys me
A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
A drop of blood a day and, being aged,
A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect
A sly and constant knave,
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady
A Gallian girl at home. He furnaces
A saucy stranger in his court to mart  
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer  
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,
A pantler- not so eminent!
A second night of such sweet shortness which  
A pudency so rosy, the sweet view on't
A world by itself, and we will nothing pay
A riding suit, no costlier than would fit
A franklin's huswife.
A cell of ignorance, travelling abed,
A prison for a debtor that not dares
A pain that only seems to seek out danger
A storm, or robbery, call it what you will,
A look untender! If't be summer news,
A little witness my obedience. Look!
A strain of rareness; and I grieve myself
A man already.
A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.
A conduct overland to Milford Haven.
A thing more made of malice than of duty;
A dram of worth be drawn.
A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,
A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
A law-breaker, a villain. Yield thee, thief.
A headless man? The garments of Posthumus?
A very valiant Briton and a good,
A grave. Come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd
A fever with the absence of her son;
A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,
A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel
A very drudge of nature's, have subdu'd me
A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,  
A stop i' th' chaser, a retire; anon
A rout, confusion thick. Forthwith they fly,
A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.
A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again
A thing of pity.
A father to me; and thou hast created
A mother and two brothers. But, O scorn,
A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer.
A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,
A shop of all the qualities that man
A sacrilegious thief, to do't. The temple
A precious thing! I had it from the Queen.
A certain stuff, which, being ta'en would cease
A banish'd traitor.
A pair of worthier sons.
A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother
A Roman and a British ensign wave
A Gentleman, courtier.
A Priest.
A Norwegian Captain.
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
A sable silver'd.
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
A double blessing is a double grace;
A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-  
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
A scullion!  
A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
A second time I kill my husband dead
A very, very- pajock.
A room in the Castle.
A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
A villain kills my father; and for that,
A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
A station like the herald Mercury
A combination and a form indeed
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
A noise within.
A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
A face without a heart,'
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
A very noble youth. Mark.
A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
A table and flagons of wine on it.  
A post from Wales, loaden with heavy news;
A thousand of his people butchered;
A gallant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not?
A son who is the theme of honour's tongue,
A pouncet box, which ever and anon
A plague upon it! it is in GIoucestershire-  
A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed,
A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
A gross fat man.
A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.
A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
A virtue that was never seen in you.
A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,
A couching lion and a ramping cat,
A good mouth-filling oath; and leave 'in sooth'
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
A mighty and a fearful head they are,
A comfort of retirement lives in this.
A larger dare to our great enterprise,
A public road near Coventry.
A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
A prodigy of fear, and a portent
A hare-brained Hotspur govern'd by a spleen.
A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,
A sword whose temper I intend to stain
A second time do such a courtesy.
A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;
A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear:
A very valiant rebel of the name.  
A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
A retreat is sounded.
A noble earl, and many a creature else
A gentleman well bred and of good name,
A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,
A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,
A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
A naked subject to the weeping clouds
A dozen captains stay at door for you.
A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?  
A certain instance that Glendower is dead.
A rotten case abides no handling.
A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,
A ragged and forestall'd remission.
A cup of wine, sir?
A cup of wine that's brisk and fine,
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,
A hundred alms-houses right well supplied;
A thousand pounds by th' year: thus runs the bill.
A fearful battle rend'red you in music.
A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'
A little cloth.
A night is but small breath and little pause
A city on th' inconstant billows dancing;
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,
A damned death!
A largess universal, like the sun,
A little touch of Harry in the night.
A good soft pillow for that good white head  
A lad of life, an imp of fame;
A very little little let us do,
A many of our bodies shall no doubt
A testament of noble-ending love.
A LAWYER
A FRENCH SERGEANT
A PORTER
A far more glorious star thy soul will make
A third thinks, without expense at all,
A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,
A holy maid hither with me I bring,
A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have plac'd;
A holy prophetess new risen up,
A woman clad in armour chaseth them.
A witch by fear, not force, like Hannibal,
A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear
A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd;
A second Hector, for his grim aspect
A thousand souls to death and deadly night.
A man of thy profession and degree;
A prophet to the fall of all our foes!
A braver soldier never couched lance,
A gentler heart did never sway in court;
A stouter champion never handled sword.
A letter was deliver'd to my hands,
A little herd of England's timorous deer,
A terrible and unavoided danger;
A field of battle
A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.
A man of great authority in France,
A goodly prize, fit for the devil's grace!
A virgin, and his servant, say to him.
A virgin from her tender infancy,
A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
A LIEUTENANT, a SHIPMASTER, a MASTER'S MATE, and WALTER WHITMORE  
A SPIRIT raised by him
A world of earthly blessings to my soul,
A day will come when York shall claim his own;
A spirit rais'd from depth of underground
A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!
A sorry breakfast for my Lord Protector.
A man that ne'er saw in his life before.
A hundred times and oft'ner, in my sleep,
A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,
A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.
A heart it was, bound in with diamonds-
A wilderness is populous enough,
A cunning man did calculate my birth  
A Roman sworder and banditto slave
A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul
A poor esquire of Kent that loves his king.
A NOBLEMAN                         TWO KEEPERS
A HUNTSMAN
A SON that has killed his father
A FATHER that has killed his son
A woman's general; what should we fear?  
A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'  
A bird that will revenge upon you all;
A crown for York!-and, lords, bow low to him.
A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire
A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day
A field of battle between Towton and Saxton, in Yorkshire
A loud alarum. Enter CLIFFORD, wounded
A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.
A chase in the north of England
A man at least, for less I should not be;
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
A cold premeditation for my purpose!
A plain in Warwickshire
A park near Middleham Castle in Yorkshire
A salve for any sore that may betide.
A parley, sirrah, to George of Clarence.
A field of battle near Barnet
A CRIER
A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
A man may weep upon his wedding-day.
A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys  
A place next to the King.
A new hell in himself.
A most poor issue?
A thing inspir'd, and, not consulting, broke
A minister in his power. You know his nature,
A full hot horse, who being allow'd his way,
A noise within, crying 'Room for the Queen!'
A single voice; and that not pass'd me but
A trembling contribution! Why, we take  
A fit or two o' th' face; but they are shrewd ones;
A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.
A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong  
A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;
A good digestion to you all; and once more
A noble company! What are their pleasures?
A thousand thanks, and pray 'em take their pleasures.
A little happier than my wretched father;
A most unnatural and faithless service.
A strong faith to conceal it.
A buzzing of a separation
A woman of less place might ask by law-
A thousand pound a year, annual support,
A very fresh-fish here-fie, fie, fie upon
A thousand pounds a year for pure respect!  
A prince most prudent, of an excellent
A year before. It is not to be question'd  
A better wife, let him in nought be trusted
A royal lady, spake one the least word that might
A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and
A strange tongue makes my cause more strange, suspicious;
A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?
A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,
A soul as even as a calm. Pray think us
A creature of the Queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'
A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain
A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to
A loyal and obedient subject is
A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune,
A league between his Highness and Ferrara.
A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,
A peace above all earthly dignities,
A still and quiet conscience. The King has cur'd me,
A load would sink a navy-too much honour.
A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.
A street in Westminster
A distance from her, while her Grace sat down
A man in much esteem with th' King, and truly
A worthy friend. The King has made him Master
A gentleman, sent from the King, to see you.
A right good husband, let him be a noble;
A queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.
A most arch heretic, a pestilence  
A quiet night, and my good mistress will  
A man of his place, and so near our favour,
A Council table brought in, with chairs and stools, and placed
A man that more detests, more stirs against,
A shrewd turn and he's your friend for ever.'
A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.
A pattern to all princes living with her,
A most unspotted lily shall she pass
A soldier by the honour-giving hand
A half-fac'd groat five hundred pound a year!
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
A foot of honour better than I was;
A will that bars the title of thy son.
A woman's will; a cank'red grandam's will!
A peaceful progress to the ocean.
A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,
A widow, husbandless, subject to fears;
A woman, naturally born to fears;
A widow cries: Be husband to me, heavens!
A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear
A mother's curse-on her revolting son.
A chafed lion by the mortal paw,
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
A rage whose heat hath this condition
A passion hateful to my purposes;
A whole armado of convicted sail
A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,
A fearful eye thou hast; where is that blood
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
A thousand businesses are brief in hand,  
A cock'red silken wanton, brave our fields
A voluntary zeal and an unurg'd faith
A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
A Soothsayer
A Poet
A public place.
A wretched creature and must bend his body
A man of such a feeble temper should
A street. Thunder and lightning.
A man no mightier than thyself or me
A shrewd contriver; and you know his means,
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.
A woman well reputed, Cato's daughter.
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
A street near the Capitol.
A crowd of people, among them Artemidorus and the Soothsayer.
A Hail, Caesar! Read this schedule.
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
A street.
A house in Rome. Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus, seated at a table.
A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds
A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,
A little from this ground.
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
A canopy most fatal, under which
A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend.
A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe,
A Captain under Edmund's command.
A Herald.
A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
A credulous father! and a brother noble,
A little to disquantity your train,
A babe to honour her! If she must teem,  
A fox when one has caught her,
A court within the Castle of the Earl of Gloucester.
A childlike office.
A plague upon your epileptic visage!  
A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
A good man's fortune may grow out at heels.
A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle  
A heath.
A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.
A farmhouse near Gloucester's Castle.
A mistress's command. Wear this.          [Gives a favour.]
A father, and a gracious aged man,
A man, a prince, by him so benefited!  
A woman's shape doth shield thee.
A troop of horse with felt. I'll put't in proof,  
A plot upon her virtuous husband's life,
A drum afar off.
A tent in the French camp.
A field between the two camps.
A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'no,'
A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.
A FORESTER
A mild of grace and complete majesty-
A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
A man of complements, whom right and wrong
A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.
A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red.
A man of sovereign parts, peerless esteem'd,
A hundred thousand more, in surety of the which,
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast,
A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
A domineering pedant o'er the boy,
A woman, that is like a German clock,
A whitely wanton with a velvet brow,
A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.
A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
A green goose a goddess- pure, pure idolatry.
A caudle, ho!
A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,  
A leg, a limb-
A true man or a thief that gallops so?
A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
A wife of such wood were felicity.
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind.
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
A huge translation of hypocrisy,
A better speech was never spoke before.
A mean most meanly; and in ushering,
A world of torments though I should endure,
A mess of Russians left us but of late.
A man so breathed that certain he would fight ye,
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue.
A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,
A wife?
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
A Scottish Doctor
A Sergeant
A Porter
A desert place. Thunder and lightning.
A camp near Forres. Alarum within.
A heath. Thunder.
A prosperous gentleman; and to be King  
A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
A limbeck only. When in swinish sleep
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
A bell rings.
A little water clears us of this deed.
A fellow to it.
A falcon towering in her pride of place
A deed of dreadful note.
A park near the palace.
A Hall in the palace. A banquet prepared.
A woman's story at a winter's fire,
A heath. Thunder.
A cavern. In the middle, a boiling cauldron. Thunder.
A show of eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand;
A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
A stanchless avarice that, were I King,
A most miraculous work in this good King,
A modern ecstasy. The dead man's knell
A cry of women within.
A JUSTICE
A pow'r I have, but of what strength and nature
A street
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
A monastery
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
A nunnery
A novice of this place, and the fair sister
A warrant for his execution.
A hall in ANGELO'S house
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
A prison
A man already made, as to remit
A merriment than a vice.
A pond as deep as hell.
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
A word of this. What ho, within! come forth.  
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
A league below the city; and from thence,
A street near the city gate
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then  
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
A very scurvy fellow.  
A marble monument!
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds
A stage, where every man must play a part,
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
A breed for barren metal of his friend?-
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.                  Exit
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
A coin that bears the figure of an angel  
A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
A vessel of our country richly fraught.
A young Venetian, one that comes before
A day in April never came so sweet
A SONG
A golden mesh t' entrap the hearts of men
A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich,
A creature that did bear the shape of man
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
A many fools that stand in better place,
A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
A losing suit against him. Are you answered?
A messenger with letters from the doctor,
A young and learned doctor to our court.
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
A substitute shines brightly as a king
A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy
A prating boy that begg'd it as a fee;
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
A room in the Garter Inn
A field near Windsor
A field near Frogmore
A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.
A street leading to the Park
A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
A wood near Athens
A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king.
A merrier hour was never wasted there.
A sweet Athenian lady is in love
A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
A million fail, confounding oath on oath.
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.
A weak bond holds you; I'll not trust your word.
A local habitation and a name.
A lion fell, nor else no lion's dam;
A fortnight hold we this solemnity,
A Sexton.
A Boy.
A room in Leonato's house.
A hall in Leonato's house.
A hall in Leonato's house.
A room in Leonato's house.
A street.
A Room in Leonato's house.
A church.
A thousand times in secret.
A thousand blushing apparitions
A sin of perjury: she not denies it.
A prison.
A third is fled--that had a hand in it.
A churchyard.
A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
A Clown in service to Othello
A council chamber. The Duke and Senators sitting at a table;
A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.
A natural and prompt alacrity
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
A man he is of honesty and trust.  
A seaport in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.
A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements.
A Veronesa. Michael Cassio,
A cry within, "A sail, a sail, a sail!"
A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
A cry within, "A sail, a sail!" Guns heard.
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,
A street.
A hall in the castle.
A soldier's a man;
A cry within, "Help, help!"
A bell rings.
A Florentine more kind and honest.
A room in the castle.
A man that languishes in your displeasure.
A stranger to thy thoughts.
A sequester from liberty, fasting, and prayer,
A frank one.
A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
A passion most unsuiting such a man-
A housewife that by selling her desires
A room in the castle.
A closet lock and key of villainous secrets.
A drop of patience; but, alas, to make me
A fixed figure for the time of scorn
A bedchamber in the castle. Desdemona in bed asleep; a light burning.
A murther, which I thought a sacrifice.
A thousand times committed. Cassio confess'd it,
A better never did itself sustain
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;
A recreant and most degenerate traitor;
A jewel in a ten-times barr'd-up chest
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
A traitor to my God, my King, and me.
A loyal, just, and upright gentleman.  
A traitor to his God, his King, and him;
A long flourish, while the KING consults his Council
A dearer merit, not so deep a maim
A partial slander sought I to avoid,
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,
A parasite, a keeper-back of death,
A banish'd traitor. All my treasury
A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
A camp in Wales
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
A glorious angel. Then, if angels fight,
A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.
A little little grave, an obscure grave-
A brittle glory shineth in this face;
A plot shall show us all a merry day.                 Exeunt
A twofold marriage-'twixt my crown and me,
A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.
A beggar begs that never begg'd before.
A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
A YOUNG SON OF CLARENCE (Edward, Earl of Warwick)
A YOUNG DAUGHTER OF CLARENCE (Margaret Plantagenet,
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman-
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
A plague upon you all! His royal Grace-
A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too.
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
A liberal rewarder of his friends;
A husband and a son thou ow'st to me;
A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon,
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
A begging prince what beggar pities not?
A sennet.
A knot you are of damned blood-suckers.
A care-craz'd mother to a many sons,
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
A happy and a joyful time of day!
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
A king!-perhaps-
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
A dire induction am I witness to,
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death.
A mother only mock'd with two fair babes,
A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag
A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble,
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
A grievous burden was thy birth to me;
A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave
A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
A grandam's name is little less in love
A royal battle might be won and lost.
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
A base foul stone, made precious by the foil
A black day will it be to somebody.
A thing devised by the enemy.
A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
A scum of Britaines, and base lackey peasants,
A milk-sop, one that never in his life  
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!             Exeunt  
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.  
A Street.
A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;
A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.
A street.
A visor for a visor! What care I
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
A villain, that is hither come in spite
A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
A street.
A lover may bestride the gossamer
A public place.
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
A gentleman of princely parentage,
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.  
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
A precious ring- a ring that I must use
A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
A lightning before death. O, how may I
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
A greater power than we can contradict
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
A LORD
A PEDANT
A WIDOW
A most delicious banquet by his bed,
A bedchamber in the LORD'S house
A flourish of trumpets announces the play
A course of learning and ingenious studies.
A merchant of great traffic through the world,
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
A man well known throughout all Italy.
A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack,
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
A horse and a man
A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
A merchant of incomparable wealth.
A velvet dish. Fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy;
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap.
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie;
A public road
A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled-
A ship at sea; afterwards an uninhabited island
A time before we came unto this cell?
A prince of power.
A falsehood, in its contrary as great
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
A treacherous army levied, one midnight
A mark so bloody on the business; but
A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg'd,
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
A most auspicious star, whose influence
A dozen years; within which space she died,
A freckl'd whelp, hag-born-not honour'd with
A human shape.
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows,
A thing divine; for nothing natural
A matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,  
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king-
A contract of true love; be not too late.  
A noise of hunters beard. Enter divers SPIRITS, in
A solemn air, and the best comforter
A hearty welcome.
A vision of the island, one dear son
A heaviness that's gone.

A FOOL
A thousand moral paintings I can show
A gentleman that well deserves a help,
A room of state in TIMON'S house
A SENATOR'S house
A visage of demand; for I do fear,
A thousand talents to me.
A public place
A hall in TIMON'S house
A moderate table.
A banqueting hall in TIMON'S house
A dedicated beggar to the air,
A pox of wrinkles!
A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'st
A stone by thee.                     [Throws a stone at him]
A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal
A CAPTAIN
A MESSENGER
A CLOWN
A NURSE, and a black CHILD
A special party, have by common voice
A nobler man, a braver warrior,
A mother's tears in passion for her son;
A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;
A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.
A father and a friend to thee and Rome.
A Roman now adopted happily,
A speedier course than ling'ring languishment
A forest near Rome
A lonely part of the forest
A very excellent piece of villainy.
A barren detested vale you see it is:
A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
A very fatal place it seems to me.
A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints;
A precious ring that lightens all this hole,
A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
A stone is soft as wax: tribunes more hard than stones.
A stone is silent and offendeth not,
A banquet.
A deed of death done on the innocent
A joyful issue.
A long-tongu'd babbling gossip? No, lords, no.
A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?
A halter, soldiers! Hang him on this tree,
A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam.
A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant  
A ROMAN. You sad Andronici, have done with woes;
A Prologue arm'd, but not in confidence
A lord of Troyan blood, nephew to Hector;
A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
A stranger to those most imperial looks
A prince called Hector-Priam is his father-
A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
A form of strangeness as we pass along.  
A very horse that has he knows not what!  
A great-siz'd monster of ingratitudes.
A woman impudent and mannish grown
A labour sav'd!
A thousand complete courses of the sun!
A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple  
A Troyan hath been slain; since she could speak,
A priest, there off'ring to it his own heart.                Exit
A victor shall be known? Will you the knights
A little proudly, and great deal misprizing
A second hope as fairly built as Hector.
A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;
A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
A great addition earned in thy death.
A thought of added honour torn from Hector.
A drop of Grecian blood. The end crowns all;
A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?
A token from her daughter, my fair love,
A guard of patience. Stay a little while.
A SEA CAPTAIN, friend of Viola
A city in Illyria; and the sea-coast near it
A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh  
A gracious person; but yet I cannot love him.
A street
A stoup of wine, Maria!
A thousand thousand to save,
A ring in chase of you; so did I abuse
A murd'rous guilt shows not itself more soon
A street
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.           Exit
A baubling vessel was he captain of,
A natural perspective, that is and is not.
A gentleman and follower of my lady's.
A most extracting frenzy of mine own
A solemn combination shall be made
A foolish thing was but a toy,
A great while ago the world begun,
A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had buried her grandam;
A journey to my loving Proteus.
A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears,
A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,
A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears;
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,
A man I am cross'd with adversity;
A linguist, and a man of such perfection
A slave that still an end turns me to shame!  
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful!
A smaller boon than this I cannot beg,
A MARINER
A GAOLER
A servant grafted in my serious trust,
A lip of much contempt, speeds from me;
A party in this alteration, finding
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril  
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
A federary with her, and one that knows
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
A school-boy's top. Away with her to prison.
A thriving issue; there is no lady living
A man, the worst about you.
A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door!
A most intelligencing bawd!
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence,
A just and open trial. While she lives,
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
A moiety of the throne, a great king's daughter,
A lady like me; with a love even such,
A lullaby too rough; I never saw
A merry heart goes all the day,
A ram and bleated; and the fire-rob'd god,
A way to make us better friends, more known.
A fair one are you- well you fit our ages
A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
A wave o' th' sea, that you might ever do
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepar'd
A place whereto you'll go?
A great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking on's teeth.
A saint-like sorrow. No fault could you make
A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
A graceful gentleman, against whose person,
A shepherd's daughter.
A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far-
A LOVER'S COMPLAINT
A plaintful story from a sist'ring vale,
A thousand favours from a maund she drew  
A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh,
A youthful suit- it was to gain my grace-
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted
A man in hue all hues in his controlling,
A dearer birth than this his love had brought
A loss in love that touches me more nearly.  
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,
A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
A third nor red, nor white, had stol'n of both,
A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
A god in love, to whom I am confined.
A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe,
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face,
A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
A dateless lively heat still to endure,
A PAGE, Servant to the Countess of Rousillon
A WIDOW OF FLORENCE.
A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,
A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,
A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;  
A braving war.
A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
A native slip to us from foreign seeds.
A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
A senseless help, when help past sense we deem.
A modest one to bear me back again.
A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame,
A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
A poor physician's daughter-thou dislik'st
A lying trophy; and as oft is dumb
A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
A balance more replete.
A young man married is a man that's marr'd.
A very serious business calls on him.
A charge too heavy for my strength; but yet
A lover of thy drum, hater of love.                   Exeunt
A tucket afar off. Enter an old WIDOW OF FLORENCE, her daughter DIANA,
A shrewd turn, if she pleas'd.
A wife of me, though there my hope be done.
A stranger, no offender; and inform him
A SOOTHSAYER
A CLOWN
A little I can read.
A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
A man who is the abstract of all faults
A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
A space for farther travel.
A better ear. Menas, I did not think
A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense  
A blessed lottery to him.
A meaner than myself; since I myself
A cistern for scal'd snakes! Go, get thee hence.
A sennet sounded. Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS,
A plain in Syria
A statue than a breather.
A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented
A soldier and his horse.
A plain near Actium
A most unnoble swerving.
A private man in Athens. This for him.
A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
A diminution in our captain's brain
A mangled shadow. Perchance to-morrow
A workman in't.
A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
A shrewd one to's.
A master-leaver and a fugitive!
A hill near Alexandria
A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
A forked mountain, or blue promontory
A million moe, now lost- she, Eros, has
A nobleness in record. But I will be
A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
A greater crack. The round world
A moiety of the world.
A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar:
A minister of her will; and it is great
A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly
A sun and moon, which kept their course and lighted
A benefit in this change; but if you seek
A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
A pair so famous. High events as these
A person representing HYMEN
A lawn before the DUKE'S palace
A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
A boar spear in my hand; and- in my heart
A thievish living on the common road?
A stubborn will to please,
A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and LORDS, like outlaws
A motley fool. A miserable world!  
A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
A scatt'red smile, and that I'll live upon.
A little riper and more lusty red
A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,
A sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?
A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,
A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
A COURTEZAN
A hall in the DUKE'S palace
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
A mean woman was delivered
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
A man is master of his liberty;
A wretched soul, bruis'd with adversity,
A sunny look of his would soon repair.
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish.
A vulgar comment will be made of it,
A husband's office? Shall, Antipholus,
A public place
A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;
A wolf, nay worse, a fellow all in buff;
A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands
A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dry-foot well;
A chain, a chain. Do you not hear it ring?
A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
A nut, a cherry-stone;
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
A street
A street before a priory
A sin prevailing much in youthful men
A charitable duty of my order;
A most outrageous fit of madness took him,
A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,
A needy, hollow-ey'd, sharp-looking wretch,
A living dead man. This pernicious slave,
A ROMAN HERALD
A CITIZEN of Antium  
A pretty tale. It may be you have heard it;
A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
A place below the first; for what miscarries
A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
A field of battle between the Roman and the Volscian camps
A bribe to pay my sword. I do refuse it,
A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius, Marcius!'
A flourish. Cornets. Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS bloody, with two or three soldiers
A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the

A sure destruction.
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
A sennet. Enter the PATRICIANS and the TRIBUNES
A little of that worthy work perform'd
A kinder value of the people than
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
A place of potency and sway o' th' state,
A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labour'd,
A man of their infirmity.
A noble life before a long, and wish
A foe to th' public weal. Obey, I charge thee,
A brand to th' end o' th' world.
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't;
A most inherent baseness.
A noble cunning. You were us'd to load me
A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
A highway between Rome and Antium
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
A worthy officer i' the war, but insolent,
A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
A trembling upon Rome, such as was never

A noble servant to them, but he could not

A pair of tribunes that have wrack'd for Rome
A private whisper- no, not with such friends
A mother less, or granted less, Aufidius?
A better witness back than words, which we,
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
A city full; of tribunes such as you,
A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
A good construction. I rais'd him, and I pawn'd
A twist of rotten silk; never admitting
A FRENCH GENTLEMAN, friend to Philario
A ROMAN CAPTAIN
A sample to the youngest; to th' more mature
A glass that feated them; and to the graver
A child that guided dotards. To his mistress,
A year's age on me!
A seat for baseness.
A lustre to it.
A man worth any woman; overbuys me
A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
A drop of blood a day and, being aged,
A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect
A sly and constant knave,
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady
A Gallian girl at home. He furnaces
A saucy stranger in his court to mart  
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer  
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,
A pantler- not so eminent!
A second night of such sweet shortness which  
A pudency so rosy, the sweet view on't
A world by itself, and we will nothing pay
A riding suit, no costlier than would fit
A franklin's huswife.
A cell of ignorance, travelling abed,
A prison for a debtor that not dares
A pain that only seems to seek out danger
A storm, or robbery, call it what you will,
A look untender! If't be summer news,
A little witness my obedience. Look!
A strain of rareness; and I grieve myself
A man already.
A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.
A conduct overland to Milford Haven.
A thing more made of malice than of duty;
A dram of worth be drawn.
A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,
A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
A law-breaker, a villain. Yield thee, thief.
A headless man? The garments of Posthumus?
A very valiant Briton and a good,
A grave. Come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd
A fever with the absence of her son;
A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,
A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel
A very drudge of nature's, have subdu'd me
A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,  
A stop i' th' chaser, a retire; anon
A rout, confusion thick. Forthwith they fly,
A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.
A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again
A thing of pity.
A father to me; and thou hast created
A mother and two brothers. But, O scorn,
A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer.
A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,
A shop of all the qualities that man
A sacrilegious thief, to do't. The temple
A precious thing! I had it from the Queen.
A certain stuff, which, being ta'en would cease
A banish'd traitor.
A pair of worthier sons.
A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother
A Roman and a British ensign wave
A Gentleman, courtier.
A Priest.
A Norwegian Captain.
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
A sable silver'd.
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
A double blessing is a double grace;
A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-  
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
A scullion!  
A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
A second time I kill my husband dead
A very, very- pajock.
A room in the Castle.
A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
A villain kills my father; and for that,
A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
A station like the herald Mercury
A combination and a form indeed
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
A noise within.
A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
A face without a heart,'
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
A very noble youth. Mark.
A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
A table and flagons of wine on it.  
A post from Wales, loaden with heavy news;
A thousand of his people butchered;
A gallant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not?
A son who is the theme of honour's tongue,
A pouncet box, which ever and anon
A plague upon it! it is in GIoucestershire-  
A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed,
A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
A gross fat man.
A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.
A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
A virtue that was never seen in you.
A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,
A couching lion and a ramping cat,
A good mouth-filling oath; and leave 'in sooth'
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
A mighty and a fearful head they are,
A comfort of retirement lives in this.
A larger dare to our great enterprise,
A public road near Coventry.
A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
A prodigy of fear, and a portent
A hare-brained Hotspur govern'd by a spleen.
A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,
A sword whose temper I intend to stain
A second time do such a courtesy.
A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;
A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear:
A very valiant rebel of the name.  
A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
A retreat is sounded.
A noble earl, and many a creature else
A gentleman well bred and of good name,
A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,
A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,
A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
A naked subject to the weeping clouds
A dozen captains stay at door for you.
A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?  
A certain instance that Glendower is dead.
A rotten case abides no handling.
A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,
A ragged and forestall'd remission.
A cup of wine, sir?
A cup of wine that's brisk and fine,
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,
A hundred alms-houses right well supplied;
A thousand pounds by th' year: thus runs the bill.
A fearful battle rend'red you in music.
A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'
A little cloth.
A night is but small breath and little pause
A city on th' inconstant billows dancing;
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,
A damned death!
A largess universal, like the sun,
A little touch of Harry in the night.
A good soft pillow for that good white head  
A lad of life, an imp of fame;
A very little little let us do,
A many of our bodies shall no doubt
A testament of noble-ending love.
A LAWYER
A FRENCH SERGEANT
A PORTER
A far more glorious star thy soul will make
A third thinks, without expense at all,
A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,
A holy maid hither with me I bring,
A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have plac'd;
A holy prophetess new risen up,
A woman clad in armour chaseth them.
A witch by fear, not force, like Hannibal,
A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear
A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd;
A second Hector, for his grim aspect
A thousand souls to death and deadly night.
A man of thy profession and degree;
A prophet to the fall of all our foes!
A braver soldier never couched lance,
A gentler heart did never sway in court;
A stouter champion never handled sword.
A letter was deliver'd to my hands,
A little herd of England's timorous deer,
A terrible and unavoided danger;
A field of battle
A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.
A man of great authority in France,
A goodly prize, fit for the devil's grace!
A virgin, and his servant, say to him.
A virgin from her tender infancy,
A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
A LIEUTENANT, a SHIPMASTER, a MASTER'S MATE, and WALTER WHITMORE  
A SPIRIT raised by him
A world of earthly blessings to my soul,
A day will come when York shall claim his own;
A spirit rais'd from depth of underground
A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!
A sorry breakfast for my Lord Protector.
A man that ne'er saw in his life before.
A hundred times and oft'ner, in my sleep,
A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,
A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.
A heart it was, bound in with diamonds-
A wilderness is populous enough,
A cunning man did calculate my birth  
A Roman sworder and banditto slave
A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul
A poor esquire of Kent that loves his king.
A NOBLEMAN                         TWO KEEPERS
A HUNTSMAN
A SON that has killed his father
A FATHER that has killed his son
A woman's general; what should we fear?  
A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'  
A bird that will revenge upon you all;
A crown for York!-and, lords, bow low to him.
A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire
A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day
A field of battle between Towton and Saxton, in Yorkshire
A loud alarum. Enter CLIFFORD, wounded
A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.
A chase in the north of England
A man at least, for less I should not be;
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
A cold premeditation for my purpose!
A plain in Warwickshire
A park near Middleham Castle in Yorkshire
A salve for any sore that may betide.
A parley, sirrah, to George of Clarence.
A field of battle near Barnet
A CRIER
A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
A man may weep upon his wedding-day.
A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys  
A place next to the King.
A new hell in himself.
A most poor issue?
A thing inspir'd, and, not consulting, broke
A minister in his power. You know his nature,
A full hot horse, who being allow'd his way,
A noise within, crying 'Room for the Queen!'
A single voice; and that not pass'd me but
A trembling contribution! Why, we take  
A fit or two o' th' face; but they are shrewd ones;
A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.
A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong  
A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;
A good digestion to you all; and once more
A noble company! What are their pleasures?
A thousand thanks, and pray 'em take their pleasures.
A little happier than my wretched father;
A most unnatural and faithless service.
A strong faith to conceal it.
A buzzing of a separation
A woman of less place might ask by law-
A thousand pound a year, annual support,
A very fresh-fish here-fie, fie, fie upon
A thousand pounds a year for pure respect!  
A prince most prudent, of an excellent
A year before. It is not to be question'd  
A better wife, let him in nought be trusted
A royal lady, spake one the least word that might
A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and
A strange tongue makes my cause more strange, suspicious;
A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?
A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,
A soul as even as a calm. Pray think us
A creature of the Queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'
A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain
A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to
A loyal and obedient subject is
A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune,
A league between his Highness and Ferrara.
A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,
A peace above all earthly dignities,
A still and quiet conscience. The King has cur'd me,
A load would sink a navy-too much honour.
A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.
A street in Westminster
A distance from her, while her Grace sat down
A man in much esteem with th' King, and truly
A worthy friend. The King has made him Master
A gentleman, sent from the King, to see you.
A right good husband, let him be a noble;
A queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.
A most arch heretic, a pestilence  
A quiet night, and my good mistress will  
A man of his place, and so near our favour,
A Council table brought in, with chairs and stools, and placed
A man that more detests, more stirs against,
A shrewd turn and he's your friend for ever.'
A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.
A pattern to all princes living with her,
A most unspotted lily shall she pass
A soldier by the honour-giving hand
A half-fac'd groat five hundred pound a year!
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
A foot of honour better than I was;
A will that bars the title of thy son.
A woman's will; a cank'red grandam's will!
A peaceful progress to the ocean.
A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,
A widow, husbandless, subject to fears;
A woman, naturally born to fears;
A widow cries: Be husband to me, heavens!
A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear
A mother's curse-on her revolting son.
A chafed lion by the mortal paw,
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
A rage whose heat hath this condition
A passion hateful to my purposes;
A whole armado of convicted sail
A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,
A fearful eye thou hast; where is that blood
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
A thousand businesses are brief in hand,  
A cock'red silken wanton, brave our fields
A voluntary zeal and an unurg'd faith
A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
A Soothsayer
A Poet
A public place.
A wretched creature and must bend his body
A man of such a feeble temper should
A street. Thunder and lightning.
A man no mightier than thyself or me
A shrewd contriver; and you know his means,
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.
A woman well reputed, Cato's daughter.
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
A street near the Capitol.
A crowd of people, among them Artemidorus and the Soothsayer.
A Hail, Caesar! Read this schedule.
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
A street.
A house in Rome. Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus, seated at a table.
A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds
A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,
A little from this ground.
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
A canopy most fatal, under which
A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend.
A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe,
A Captain under Edmund's command.
A Herald.
A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
A credulous father! and a brother noble,
A little to disquantity your train,
A babe to honour her! If she must teem,  
A fox when one has caught her,
A court within the Castle of the Earl of Gloucester.
A childlike office.
A plague upon your epileptic visage!  
A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
A good man's fortune may grow out at heels.
A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle  
A heath.
A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.
A farmhouse near Gloucester's Castle.
A mistress's command. Wear this.          [Gives a favour.]
A father, and a gracious aged man,
A man, a prince, by him so benefited!  
A woman's shape doth shield thee.
A troop of horse with felt. I'll put't in proof,  
A plot upon her virtuous husband's life,
A drum afar off.
A tent in the French camp.
A field between the two camps.
A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'no,'
A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.
A FORESTER
A mild of grace and complete majesty-
A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
A man of complements, whom right and wrong
A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.
A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red.
A man of sovereign parts, peerless esteem'd,
A hundred thousand more, in surety of the which,
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast,
A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
A domineering pedant o'er the boy,
A woman, that is like a German clock,
A whitely wanton with a velvet brow,
A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.
A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
A green goose a goddess- pure, pure idolatry.
A caudle, ho!
A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,  
A leg, a limb-
A true man or a thief that gallops so?
A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
A wife of such wood were felicity.
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind.
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
A huge translation of hypocrisy,
A better speech was never spoke before.
A mean most meanly; and in ushering,
A world of torments though I should endure,
A mess of Russians left us but of late.
A man so breathed that certain he would fight ye,
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue.
A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,
A wife?
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
A Scottish Doctor
A Sergeant
A Porter
A desert place. Thunder and lightning.
A camp near Forres. Alarum within.
A heath. Thunder.
A prosperous gentleman; and to be King  
A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
A limbeck only. When in swinish sleep
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
A bell rings.
A little water clears us of this deed.
A fellow to it.
A falcon towering in her pride of place
A deed of dreadful note.
A park near the palace.
A Hall in the palace. A banquet prepared.
A woman's story at a winter's fire,
A heath. Thunder.
A cavern. In the middle, a boiling cauldron. Thunder.
A show of eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand;
A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
A stanchless avarice that, were I King,
A most miraculous work in this good King,
A modern ecstasy. The dead man's knell
A cry of women within.
A JUSTICE
A pow'r I have, but of what strength and nature
A street
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
A monastery
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
A nunnery
A novice of this place, and the fair sister
A warrant for his execution.
A hall in ANGELO'S house
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
A prison
A man already made, as to remit
A merriment than a vice.
A pond as deep as hell.
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
A word of this. What ho, within! come forth.  
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
A league below the city; and from thence,
A street near the city gate
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then  
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
A very scurvy fellow.  
A marble monument!
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds
A stage, where every man must play a part,
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
A breed for barren metal of his friend?-
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.                  Exit
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
A coin that bears the figure of an angel  
A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
A vessel of our country richly fraught.
A young Venetian, one that comes before
A day in April never came so sweet
A SONG
A golden mesh t' entrap the hearts of men
A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich,
A creature that did bear the shape of man
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
A many fools that stand in better place,
A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
A losing suit against him. Are you answered?
A messenger with letters from the doctor,
A young and learned doctor to our court.
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
A substitute shines brightly as a king
A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy
A prating boy that begg'd it as a fee;
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
A room in the Garter Inn
A field near Windsor
A field near Frogmore
A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.
A street leading to the Park
A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
A wood near Athens
A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king.
A merrier hour was never wasted there.
A sweet Athenian lady is in love
A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
A million fail, confounding oath on oath.
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.
A weak bond holds you; I'll not trust your word.
A local habitation and a name.
A lion fell, nor else no lion's dam;
A fortnight hold we this solemnity,
A Sexton.
A Boy.
A room in Leonato's house.
A hall in Leonato's house.
A hall in Leonato's house.
A room in Leonato's house.
A street.
A Room in Leonato's house.
A church.
A thousand times in secret.
A thousand blushing apparitions
A sin of perjury: she not denies it.
A prison.
A third is fled--that had a hand in it.
A churchyard.
A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
A Clown in service to Othello
A council chamber. The Duke and Senators sitting at a table;
A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.
A natural and prompt alacrity
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
A man he is of honesty and trust.  
A seaport in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.
A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements.
A Veronesa. Michael Cassio,
A cry within, "A sail, a sail, a sail!"
A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
A cry within, "A sail, a sail!" Guns heard.
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,
A street.
A hall in the castle.
A soldier's a man;
A cry within, "Help, help!"
A bell rings.
A Florentine more kind and honest.
A room in the castle.
A man that languishes in your displeasure.
A stranger to thy thoughts.
A sequester from liberty, fasting, and prayer,
A frank one.
A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
A passion most unsuiting such a man-
A housewife that by selling her desires
A room in the castle.
A closet lock and key of villainous secrets.
A drop of patience; but, alas, to make me
A fixed figure for the time of scorn
A bedchamber in the castle. Desdemona in bed asleep; a light burning.
A murther, which I thought a sacrifice.
A thousand times committed. Cassio confess'd it,
A better never did itself sustain
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;
A recreant and most degenerate traitor;
A jewel in a ten-times barr'd-up chest
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
A traitor to my God, my King, and me.
A loyal, just, and upright gentleman.  
A traitor to his God, his King, and him;
A long flourish, while the KING consults his Council
A dearer merit, not so deep a maim
A partial slander sought I to avoid,
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,
A parasite, a keeper-back of death,
A banish'd traitor. All my treasury
A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
A camp in Wales
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
A glorious angel. Then, if angels fight,
A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.
A little little grave, an obscure grave-
A brittle glory shineth in this face;
A plot shall show us all a merry day.                 Exeunt
A twofold marriage-'twixt my crown and me,
A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.
A beggar begs that never begg'd before.
A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
A YOUNG SON OF CLARENCE (Edward, Earl of Warwick)
A YOUNG DAUGHTER OF CLARENCE (Margaret Plantagenet,
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman-
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
A plague upon you all! His royal Grace-
A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too.
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
A liberal rewarder of his friends;
A husband and a son thou ow'st to me;
A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon,
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
A begging prince what beggar pities not?
A sennet.
A knot you are of damned blood-suckers.
A care-craz'd mother to a many sons,
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
A happy and a joyful time of day!
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
A king!-perhaps-
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
A dire induction am I witness to,
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death.
A mother only mock'd with two fair babes,
A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag
A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble,
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
A grievous burden was thy birth to me;
A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave
A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
A grandam's name is little less in love
A royal battle might be won and lost.
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
A base foul stone, made precious by the foil
A black day will it be to somebody.
A thing devised by the enemy.
A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
A scum of Britaines, and base lackey peasants,
A milk-sop, one that never in his life  
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!             Exeunt  
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.  
A Street.
A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;
A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.
A street.
A visor for a visor! What care I
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
A villain, that is hither come in spite
A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
A street.
A lover may bestride the gossamer
A public place.
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
A gentleman of princely parentage,
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.  
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
A precious ring- a ring that I must use
A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
A lightning before death. O, how may I
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
A greater power than we can contradict
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
A LORD
A PEDANT
A WIDOW
A most delicious banquet by his bed,
A bedchamber in the LORD'S house
A flourish of trumpets announces the play
A course of learning and ingenious studies.
A merchant of great traffic through the world,
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
A man well known throughout all Italy.
A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack,
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
A horse and a man
A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
A merchant of incomparable wealth.
A velvet dish. Fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy;
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap.
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie;
A public road
A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled-
A ship at sea; afterwards an uninhabited island
A time before we came unto this cell?
A prince of power.
A falsehood, in its contrary as great
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
A treacherous army levied, one midnight
A mark so bloody on the business; but
A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg'd,
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
A most auspicious star, whose influence
A dozen years; within which space she died,
A freckl'd whelp, hag-born-not honour'd with
A human shape.
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows,
A thing divine; for nothing natural
A matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,  
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king-
A contract of true love; be not too late.  
A noise of hunters beard. Enter divers SPIRITS, in
A solemn air, and the best comforter
A hearty welcome.
A vision of the island, one dear son
A heaviness that's gone.

A FOOL
A thousand moral paintings I can show
A gentleman that well deserves a help,
A room of state in TIMON'S house
A SENATOR'S house
A visage of demand; for I do fear,
A thousand talents to me.
A public place
A hall in TIMON'S house
A moderate table.
A banqueting hall in TIMON'S house
A dedicated beggar to the air,
A pox of wrinkles!
A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'st
A stone by thee.                     [Throws a stone at him]
A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal
A CAPTAIN
A MESSENGER
A CLOWN
A NURSE, and a black CHILD
A special party, have by common voice
A nobler man, a braver warrior,
A mother's tears in passion for her son;
A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;
A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.
A father and a friend to thee and Rome.
A Roman now adopted happily,
A speedier course than ling'ring languishment
A forest near Rome
A lonely part of the forest
A very excellent piece of villainy.
A barren detested vale you see it is:
A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
A very fatal place it seems to me.
A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints;
A precious ring that lightens all this hole,
A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
A stone is soft as wax: tribunes more hard than stones.
A stone is silent and offendeth not,
A banquet.
A deed of death done on the innocent
A joyful issue.
A long-tongu'd babbling gossip? No, lords, no.
A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?
A halter, soldiers! Hang him on this tree,
A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam.
A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant  
A ROMAN. You sad Andronici, have done with woes;
A Prologue arm'd, but not in confidence
A lord of Troyan blood, nephew to Hector;
A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
A stranger to those most imperial looks
A prince called Hector-Priam is his father-
A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
A form of strangeness as we pass along.  
A very horse that has he knows not what!  
A great-siz'd monster of ingratitudes.
A woman impudent and mannish grown
A labour sav'd!
A thousand complete courses of the sun!
A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple  
A Troyan hath been slain; since she could speak,
A priest, there off'ring to it his own heart.                Exit
A victor shall be known? Will you the knights
A little proudly, and great deal misprizing
A second hope as fairly built as Hector.
A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;
A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
A great addition earned in thy death.
A thought of added honour torn from Hector.
A drop of Grecian blood. The end crowns all;
A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?
A token from her daughter, my fair love,
A guard of patience. Stay a little while.
A SEA CAPTAIN, friend of Viola
A city in Illyria; and the sea-coast near it
A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh  
A gracious person; but yet I cannot love him.
A street
A stoup of wine, Maria!
A thousand thousand to save,
A ring in chase of you; so did I abuse
A murd'rous guilt shows not itself more soon
A street
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.           Exit
A baubling vessel was he captain of,
A natural perspective, that is and is not.
A gentleman and follower of my lady's.
A most extracting frenzy of mine own
A solemn combination shall be made
A foolish thing was but a toy,
A great while ago the world begun,
A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had buried her grandam;
A journey to my loving Proteus.
A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears,
A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,
A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears;
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,
A man I am cross'd with adversity;
A linguist, and a man of such perfection
A slave that still an end turns me to shame!  
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful!
A smaller boon than this I cannot beg,
A MARINER
A GAOLER
A servant grafted in my serious trust,
A lip of much contempt, speeds from me;
A party in this alteration, finding
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril  
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
A federary with her, and one that knows
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
A school-boy's top. Away with her to prison.
A thriving issue; there is no lady living
A man, the worst about you.
A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door!
A most intelligencing bawd!
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence,
A just and open trial. While she lives,
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
A moiety of the throne, a great king's daughter,
A lady like me; with a love even such,
A lullaby too rough; I never saw
A merry heart goes all the day,
A ram and bleated; and the fire-rob'd god,
A way to make us better friends, more known.
A fair one are you- well you fit our ages
A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
A wave o' th' sea, that you might ever do
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepar'd
A place whereto you'll go?
A great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking on's teeth.
A saint-like sorrow. No fault could you make
A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
A graceful gentleman, against whose person,
A shepherd's daughter.
A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far-
A LOVER'S COMPLAINT
A plaintful story from a sist'ring vale,
A thousand favours from a maund she drew  
A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh,
A youthful suit- it was to gain my grace-
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted
A man in hue all hues in his controlling,
A dearer birth than this his love had brought
A loss in love that touches me more nearly.  
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,
A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
A third nor red, nor white, had stol'n of both,
A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
A god in love, to whom I am confined.
A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe,
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face,
A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
A dateless lively heat still to endure,
A PAGE, Servant to the Countess of Rousillon
A WIDOW OF FLORENCE.
A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,
A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,
A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;  
A braving war.
A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
A native slip to us from foreign seeds.
A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
A senseless help, when help past sense we deem.
A modest one to bear me back again.
A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame,
A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
A poor physician's daughter-thou dislik'st
A lying trophy; and as oft is dumb
A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
A balance more replete.
A young man married is a man that's marr'd.
A very serious business calls on him.
A charge too heavy for my strength; but yet
A lover of thy drum, hater of love.                   Exeunt
A tucket afar off. Enter an old WIDOW OF FLORENCE, her daughter DIANA,
A shrewd turn, if she pleas'd.
A wife of me, though there my hope be done.
A stranger, no offender; and inform him
A SOOTHSAYER
A CLOWN
A little I can read.
A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
A man who is the abstract of all faults
A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
A space for farther travel.
A better ear. Menas, I did not think
A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense  
A blessed lottery to him.
A meaner than myself; since I myself
A cistern for scal'd snakes! Go, get thee hence.
A sennet sounded. Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS,
A plain in Syria
A statue than a breather.
A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented
A soldier and his horse.
A plain near Actium
A most unnoble swerving.
A private man in Athens. This for him.
A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
A diminution in our captain's brain
A mangled shadow. Perchance to-morrow
A workman in't.
A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
A shrewd one to's.
A master-leaver and a fugitive!
A hill near Alexandria
A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
A forked mountain, or blue promontory
A million moe, now lost- she, Eros, has
A nobleness in record. But I will be
A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
A greater crack. The round world
A moiety of the world.
A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar:
A minister of her will; and it is great
A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly
A sun and moon, which kept their course and lighted
A benefit in this change; but if you seek
A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
A pair so famous. High events as these
A person representing HYMEN
A lawn before the DUKE'S palace
A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
A boar spear in my hand; and- in my heart
A thievish living on the common road?
A stubborn will to please,
A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and LORDS, like outlaws
A motley fool. A miserable world!  
A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
A scatt'red smile, and that I'll live upon.
A little riper and more lusty red
A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,
A sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?
A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,
A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
A COURTEZAN
A hall in the DUKE'S palace
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
A mean woman was delivered
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
A man is master of his liberty;
A wretched soul, bruis'd with adversity,
A sunny look of his would soon repair.
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish.
A vulgar comment will be made of it,
A husband's office? Shall, Antipholus,
A public place
A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;
A wolf, nay worse, a fellow all in buff;
A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands
A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dry-foot well;
A chain, a chain. Do you not hear it ring?
A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
A nut, a cherry-stone;
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
A street
A street before a priory
A sin prevailing much in youthful men
A charitable duty of my order;
A most outrageous fit of madness took him,
A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,
A needy, hollow-ey'd, sharp-looking wretch,
A living dead man. This pernicious slave,
A ROMAN HERALD
A CITIZEN of Antium  
A pretty tale. It may be you have heard it;
A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
A place below the first; for what miscarries
A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
A field of battle between the Roman and the Volscian camps
A bribe to pay my sword. I do refuse it,
A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius, Marcius!'
A flourish. Cornets. Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS bloody, with two or three soldiers
A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the
A curse begin at very root on's heart
A sure destruction.
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
A sennet. Enter the PATRICIANS and the TRIBUNES
A little of that worthy work perform'd
A kinder value of the people than
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
A place of potency and sway o' th' state,
A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labour'd,
A man of their infirmity.
A noble life before a long, and wish
A foe to th' public weal. Obey, I charge thee,
A brand to th' end o' th' world.
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't;
A most inherent baseness.
A noble cunning. You were us'd to load me
A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
A highway between Rome and Antium
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
A worthy officer i' the war, but insolent,
A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
A camp at a short distance from Rome
A noble servant to them, but he could not
A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
A pair of tribunes that have wrack'd for Rome
A private whisper- no, not with such friends
A mother less, or granted less, Aufidius?
A better witness back than words, which we,
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
A city full; of tribunes such as you,
A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
A good construction. I rais'd him, and I pawn'd
A twist of rotten silk; never admitting
A FRENCH GENTLEMAN, friend to Philario
A ROMAN CAPTAIN
A sample to the youngest; to th' more mature
A glass that feated them; and to the graver
A child that guided dotards. To his mistress,
A year's age on me!
A seat for baseness.
A lustre to it.
A man worth any woman; overbuys me
A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
A drop of blood a day and, being aged,
A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect
A sly and constant knave,
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady
A Gallian girl at home. He furnaces
A saucy stranger in his court to mart  
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer  
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,
A pantler- not so eminent!
A second night of such sweet shortness which  
A pudency so rosy, the sweet view on't
A world by itself, and we will nothing pay
A riding suit, no costlier than would fit
A franklin's huswife.
A cell of ignorance, travelling abed,
A prison for a debtor that not dares
A pain that only seems to seek out danger
A storm, or robbery, call it what you will,
A look untender! If't be summer news,
A little witness my obedience. Look!
A strain of rareness; and I grieve myself
A man already.
A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.
A conduct overland to Milford Haven.
A thing more made of malice than of duty;
A dram of worth be drawn.
A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,
A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
A law-breaker, a villain. Yield thee, thief.
A headless man? The garments of Posthumus?
A very valiant Briton and a good,
A grave. Come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd
A fever with the absence of her son;
A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,
A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel
A very drudge of nature's, have subdu'd me
A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,  
A stop i' th' chaser, a retire; anon
A rout, confusion thick. Forthwith they fly,
A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.
A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again
A thing of pity.
A father to me; and thou hast created
A mother and two brothers. But, O scorn,
A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer.
A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,
A shop of all the qualities that man
A sacrilegious thief, to do't. The temple
A precious thing! I had it from the Queen.
A certain stuff, which, being ta'en would cease
A banish'd traitor.
A pair of worthier sons.
A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother
A Roman and a British ensign wave
A Gentleman, courtier.
A Priest.
A Norwegian Captain.
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
A sable silver'd.
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
A double blessing is a double grace;
A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-  
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
A scullion!  
A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
A second time I kill my husband dead
A very, very- pajock.
A room in the Castle.
A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
A villain kills my father; and for that,
A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
A station like the herald Mercury
A combination and a form indeed
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
A noise within.
A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
A face without a heart,'
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
A very noble youth. Mark.
A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
A table and flagons of wine on it.  
A post from Wales, loaden with heavy news;
A thousand of his people butchered;
A gallant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not?
A son who is the theme of honour's tongue,
A pouncet box, which ever and anon
A plague upon it! it is in GIoucestershire-  
A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed,
A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
A gross fat man.
A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.
A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
A virtue that was never seen in you.
A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,
A couching lion and a ramping cat,
A good mouth-filling oath; and leave 'in sooth'
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
A mighty and a fearful head they are,
A comfort of retirement lives in this.
A larger dare to our great enterprise,
A public road near Coventry.
A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
A prodigy of fear, and a portent
A hare-brained Hotspur govern'd by a spleen.
A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,
A sword whose temper I intend to stain
A second time do such a courtesy.
A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;
A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear:
A very valiant rebel of the name.  
A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
A retreat is sounded.
A noble earl, and many a creature else
A gentleman well bred and of good name,
A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,
A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,
A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
A naked subject to the weeping clouds
A dozen captains stay at door for you.
A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?  
A certain instance that Glendower is dead.
A rotten case abides no handling.
A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,
A ragged and forestall'd remission.
A cup of wine, sir?
A cup of wine that's brisk and fine,
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,
A hundred alms-houses right well supplied;
A thousand pounds by th' year: thus runs the bill.
A fearful battle rend'red you in music.
A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'
A little cloth.
A night is but small breath and little pause
A city on th' inconstant billows dancing;
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,
A damned death!
A largess universal, like the sun,
A little touch of Harry in the night.
A good soft pillow for that good white head  
A lad of life, an imp of fame;
A very little little let us do,
A many of our bodies shall no doubt
A testament of noble-ending love.
A LAWYER
A FRENCH SERGEANT
A PORTER
A far more glorious star thy soul will make
A third thinks, without expense at all,
A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,
A holy maid hither with me I bring,
A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have plac'd;
A holy prophetess new risen up,
A woman clad in armour chaseth them.
A witch by fear, not force, like Hannibal,
A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear
A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd;
A second Hector, for his grim aspect
A thousand souls to death and deadly night.
A man of thy profession and degree;
A prophet to the fall of all our foes!
A braver soldier never couched lance,
A gentler heart did never sway in court;
A stouter champion never handled sword.
A letter was deliver'd to my hands,
A little herd of England's timorous deer,
A terrible and unavoided danger;
A field of battle
A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.
A man of great authority in France,
A goodly prize, fit for the devil's grace!
A virgin, and his servant, say to him.
A virgin from her tender infancy,
A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
A LIEUTENANT, a SHIPMASTER, a MASTER'S MATE, and WALTER WHITMORE  
A SPIRIT raised by him
A world of earthly blessings to my soul,
A day will come when York shall claim his own;
A spirit rais'd from depth of underground
A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!
A sorry breakfast for my Lord Protector.
A man that ne'er saw in his life before.
A hundred times and oft'ner, in my sleep,
A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,
A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.
A heart it was, bound in with diamonds-
A wilderness is populous enough,
A cunning man did calculate my birth  
A Roman sworder and banditto slave
A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul
A poor esquire of Kent that loves his king.
A NOBLEMAN                         TWO KEEPERS
A HUNTSMAN
A SON that has killed his father
A FATHER that has killed his son
A woman's general; what should we fear?  
A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'  
A bird that will revenge upon you all;
A crown for York!-and, lords, bow low to him.
A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire
A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day
A field of battle between Towton and Saxton, in Yorkshire
A loud alarum. Enter CLIFFORD, wounded
A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.
A chase in the north of England
A man at least, for less I should not be;
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
A cold premeditation for my purpose!
A plain in Warwickshire
A park near Middleham Castle in Yorkshire
A salve for any sore that may betide.
A parley, sirrah, to George of Clarence.
A field of battle near Barnet
A CRIER
A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
A man may weep upon his wedding-day.
A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys  
A place next to the King.
A new hell in himself.
A most poor issue?
A thing inspir'd, and, not consulting, broke
A minister in his power. You know his nature,
A full hot horse, who being allow'd his way,
A noise within, crying 'Room for the Queen!'
A single voice; and that not pass'd me but
A trembling contribution! Why, we take  
A fit or two o' th' face; but they are shrewd ones;
A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.
A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong  
A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;
A good digestion to you all; and once more
A noble company! What are their pleasures?
A thousand thanks, and pray 'em take their pleasures.
A little happier than my wretched father;
A most unnatural and faithless service.
A strong faith to conceal it.
A buzzing of a separation
A woman of less place might ask by law-
A thousand pound a year, annual support,
A very fresh-fish here-fie, fie, fie upon
A thousand pounds a year for pure respect!  
A prince most prudent, of an excellent
A year before. It is not to be question'd  
A better wife, let him in nought be trusted
A royal lady, spake one the least word that might
A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and
A strange tongue makes my cause more strange, suspicious;
A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?
A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,
A soul as even as a calm. Pray think us
A creature of the Queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'
A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain
A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to
A loyal and obedient subject is
A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune,
A league between his Highness and Ferrara.
A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,
A peace above all earthly dignities,
A still and quiet conscience. The King has cur'd me,
A load would sink a navy-too much honour.
A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.
A street in Westminster
A distance from her, while her Grace sat down
A man in much esteem with th' King, and truly
A worthy friend. The King has made him Master
A gentleman, sent from the King, to see you.
A right good husband, let him be a noble;
A queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.
A most arch heretic, a pestilence  
A quiet night, and my good mistress will  
A man of his place, and so near our favour,
A Council table brought in, with chairs and stools, and placed
A man that more detests, more stirs against,
A shrewd turn and he's your friend for ever.'
A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.
A pattern to all princes living with her,
A most unspotted lily shall she pass
A soldier by the honour-giving hand
A half-fac'd groat five hundred pound a year!
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
A foot of honour better than I was;
A will that bars the title of thy son.
A woman's will; a cank'red grandam's will!
A peaceful progress to the ocean.
A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,
A widow, husbandless, subject to fears;
A woman, naturally born to fears;
A widow cries: Be husband to me, heavens!
A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear
A mother's curse-on her revolting son.
A chafed lion by the mortal paw,
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
A rage whose heat hath this condition
A passion hateful to my purposes;
A whole armado of convicted sail
A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,
A fearful eye thou hast; where is that blood
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
A thousand businesses are brief in hand,  
A cock'red silken wanton, brave our fields
A voluntary zeal and an unurg'd faith
A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
A Soothsayer
A Poet
A public place.
A wretched creature and must bend his body
A man of such a feeble temper should
A street. Thunder and lightning.
A man no mightier than thyself or me
A shrewd contriver; and you know his means,
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.
A woman well reputed, Cato's daughter.
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
A street near the Capitol.
A crowd of people, among them Artemidorus and the Soothsayer.
A Hail, Caesar! Read this schedule.
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
A street.
A house in Rome. Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus, seated at a table.
A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds
A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,
A little from this ground.
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
A canopy most fatal, under which
A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend.
A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe,
A Captain under Edmund's command.
A Herald.
A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
A credulous father! and a brother noble,
A little to disquantity your train,
A babe to honour her! If she must teem,  
A fox when one has caught her,
A court within the Castle of the Earl of Gloucester.
A childlike office.
A plague upon your epileptic visage!  
A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
A good man's fortune may grow out at heels.
A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle  
A heath.
A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.
A farmhouse near Gloucester's Castle.
A mistress's command. Wear this.          [Gives a favour.]
A father, and a gracious aged man,
A man, a prince, by him so benefited!  
A woman's shape doth shield thee.
A troop of horse with felt. I'll put't in proof,  
A plot upon her virtuous husband's life,
A drum afar off.
A tent in the French camp.
A field between the two camps.
A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'no,'
A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.
A FORESTER
A mild of grace and complete majesty-
A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
A man of complements, whom right and wrong
A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.
A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red.
A man of sovereign parts, peerless esteem'd,
A hundred thousand more, in surety of the which,
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast,
A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
A domineering pedant o'er the boy,
A woman, that is like a German clock,
A whitely wanton with a velvet brow,
A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.
A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
A green goose a goddess- pure, pure idolatry.
A caudle, ho!
A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,  
A leg, a limb-
A true man or a thief that gallops so?
A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
A wife of such wood were felicity.
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind.
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
A huge translation of hypocrisy,
A better speech was never spoke before.
A mean most meanly; and in ushering,
A world of torments though I should endure,
A mess of Russians left us but of late.
A man so breathed that certain he would fight ye,
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue.
A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,
A wife?
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
A Scottish Doctor
A Sergeant
A Porter
A desert place. Thunder and lightning.
A camp near Forres. Alarum within.
A heath. Thunder.
A prosperous gentleman; and to be King  
A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
A limbeck only. When in swinish sleep
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
A bell rings.
A little water clears us of this deed.
A fellow to it.
A falcon towering in her pride of place
A deed of dreadful note.
A park near the palace.
A Hall in the palace. A banquet prepared.
A woman's story at a winter's fire,
A heath. Thunder.
A cavern. In the middle, a boiling cauldron. Thunder.
A show of eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand;
A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
A stanchless avarice that, were I King,
A most miraculous work in this good King,
A modern ecstasy. The dead man's knell
A cry of women within.
A JUSTICE
A pow'r I have, but of what strength and nature
A street
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
A monastery
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
A nunnery
A novice of this place, and the fair sister
A warrant for his execution.
A hall in ANGELO'S house
A natural guiltiness such as is his,
A prison
A man already made, as to remit
A merriment than a vice.
A pond as deep as hell.
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
A word of this. What ho, within! come forth.  
A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
A league below the city; and from thence,
A street near the city gate
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
A business for yourself, pray heaven you then  
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
A very scurvy fellow.  
A marble monument!
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds
A stage, where every man must play a part,
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
A breed for barren metal of his friend?-
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.                  Exit
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
A coin that bears the figure of an angel  
A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
A vessel of our country richly fraught.
A young Venetian, one that comes before
A day in April never came so sweet
A SONG
A golden mesh t' entrap the hearts of men
A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich,
A creature that did bear the shape of man
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
A many fools that stand in better place,
A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
A losing suit against him. Are you answered?
A messenger with letters from the doctor,
A young and learned doctor to our court.
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
A substitute shines brightly as a king
A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy
A prating boy that begg'd it as a fee;
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
A room in the Garter Inn
A field near Windsor
A field near Frogmore
A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.
A street leading to the Park
A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
A wood near Athens
A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king.
A merrier hour was never wasted there.
A sweet Athenian lady is in love
A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
A million fail, confounding oath on oath.
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.
A weak bond holds you; I'll not trust your word.
A local habitation and a name.
A lion fell, nor else no lion's dam;
A fortnight hold we this solemnity,
A Sexton.
A Boy.
A room in Leonato's house.
A hall in Leonato's house.
A hall in Leonato's house.
A room in Leonato's house.
A street.
A Room in Leonato's house.
A church.
A thousand times in secret.
A thousand blushing apparitions
A sin of perjury: she not denies it.
A prison.
A third is fled--that had a hand in it.
A churchyard.
A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
A Clown in service to Othello
A council chamber. The Duke and Senators sitting at a table;
A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.
A natural and prompt alacrity
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
A man he is of honesty and trust.  
A seaport in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.
A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements.
A Veronesa. Michael Cassio,
A cry within, "A sail, a sail, a sail!"
A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
A cry within, "A sail, a sail!" Guns heard.
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,
A street.
A hall in the castle.
A soldier's a man;
A cry within, "Help, help!"
A bell rings.
A Florentine more kind and honest.
A room in the castle.
A man that languishes in your displeasure.
A stranger to thy thoughts.
A sequester from liberty, fasting, and prayer,
A frank one.
A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
A passion most unsuiting such a man-
A housewife that by selling her desires
A room in the castle.
A closet lock and key of villainous secrets.
A drop of patience; but, alas, to make me
A fixed figure for the time of scorn
A bedchamber in the castle. Desdemona in bed asleep; a light burning.
A murther, which I thought a sacrifice.
A thousand times committed. Cassio confess'd it,
A better never did itself sustain
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;
A recreant and most degenerate traitor;
A jewel in a ten-times barr'd-up chest
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
A traitor to my God, my King, and me.
A loyal, just, and upright gentleman.  
A traitor to his God, his King, and him;
A long flourish, while the KING consults his Council
A dearer merit, not so deep a maim
A partial slander sought I to avoid,
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,
A parasite, a keeper-back of death,
A banish'd traitor. All my treasury
A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
A camp in Wales
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
A glorious angel. Then, if angels fight,
A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.
A little little grave, an obscure grave-
A brittle glory shineth in this face;
A plot shall show us all a merry day.                 Exeunt
A twofold marriage-'twixt my crown and me,
A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.
A beggar begs that never begg'd before.
A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
A YOUNG SON OF CLARENCE (Edward, Earl of Warwick)
A YOUNG DAUGHTER OF CLARENCE (Margaret Plantagenet,
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman-
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
A plague upon you all! His royal Grace-
A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too.
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
A liberal rewarder of his friends;
A husband and a son thou ow'st to me;
A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon,
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
A begging prince what beggar pities not?
A sennet.
A knot you are of damned blood-suckers.
A care-craz'd mother to a many sons,
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
A happy and a joyful time of day!
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
A king!-perhaps-
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
A dire induction am I witness to,
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death.
A mother only mock'd with two fair babes,
A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag
A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble,
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
A grievous burden was thy birth to me;
A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave
A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
A grandam's name is little less in love
A royal battle might be won and lost.
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
A base foul stone, made precious by the foil
A black day will it be to somebody.
A thing devised by the enemy.
A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
A scum of Britaines, and base lackey peasants,
A milk-sop, one that never in his life  
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!             Exeunt  
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.  
A Street.
A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;
A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.
A street.
A visor for a visor! What care I
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
A villain, that is hither come in spite
A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
A street.
A lover may bestride the gossamer
A public place.
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
A gentleman of princely parentage,
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.  
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
A precious ring- a ring that I must use
A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
A lightning before death. O, how may I
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
A greater power than we can contradict
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
A LORD
A PEDANT
A WIDOW
A most delicious banquet by his bed,
A bedchamber in the LORD'S house
A flourish of trumpets announces the play
A course of learning and ingenious studies.
A merchant of great traffic through the world,
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
A man well known throughout all Italy.
A mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack,
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.
A horse and a man
A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
A merchant of incomparable wealth.
A velvet dish. Fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy;
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap.
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie;
A public road
A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled-
A ship at sea; afterwards an uninhabited island
A time before we came unto this cell?
A prince of power.
A falsehood, in its contrary as great
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
A treacherous army levied, one midnight
A mark so bloody on the business; but
A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg'd,
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
A most auspicious star, whose influence
A dozen years; within which space she died,
A freckl'd whelp, hag-born-not honour'd with
A human shape.
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows,
A thing divine; for nothing natural
A matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,  
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king-
A contract of true love; be not too late.  
A noise of hunters beard. Enter divers SPIRITS, in
A solemn air, and the best comforter
A hearty welcome.
A vision of the island, one dear son
A heaviness that's gone.

A gentleman that well deserves a help,
A room of state in TIMON'S house
A SENATOR'S house
A visage of demand; for I do fear,
A thousand talents to me.
A public place
A hall in TIMON'S house
A moderate table.
A banqueting hall in TIMON'S house
A dedicated beggar to the air,
A pox of wrinkles!
A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'st
A stone by thee.                     [Throws a stone at him]
A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal
A CAPTAIN
A MESSENGER
A CLOWN
A NURSE, and a black CHILD
A special party, have by common voice
A nobler man, a braver warrior,
A mother's tears in passion for her son;
A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;
A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.
A father and a friend to thee and Rome.
A Roman now adopted happily,
A speedier course than ling'ring languishment
A forest near Rome
A lonely part of the forest
A very excellent piece of villainy.
A barren detested vale you see it is:
A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
A very fatal place it seems to me.
A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints;
A precious ring that lightens all this hole,
A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
A stone is soft as wax: tribunes more hard than stones.
A stone is silent and offendeth not,
A banquet.
A deed of death done on the innocent
A joyful issue.
A long-tongu'd babbling gossip? No, lords, no.
A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?
A halter, soldiers! Hang him on this tree,
A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam.
A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant  
A ROMAN. You sad Andronici, have done with woes;
A Prologue arm'd, but not in confidence
A lord of Troyan blood, nephew to Hector;
A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
A stranger to those most imperial looks
A prince called Hector-Priam is his father-
A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
A form of strangeness as we pass along.  
A very horse that has he knows not what!  
A great-siz'd monster of ingratitudes.
A woman impudent and mannish grown
A labour sav'd!
A thousand complete courses of the sun!
A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple  
A Troyan hath been slain; since she could speak,
A priest, there off'ring to it his own heart.                Exit
A victor shall be known? Will you the knights
A little proudly, and great deal misprizing
A second hope as fairly built as Hector.
A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;
A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
A great addition earned in thy death.
A thought of added honour torn from Hector.
A drop of Grecian blood. The end crowns all;
A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?
A token from her daughter, my fair love,
A guard of patience. Stay a little while.
A SEA CAPTAIN, friend of Viola
A city in Illyria; and the sea-coast near it
A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh  
A gracious person; but yet I cannot love him.
A street
A stoup of wine, Maria!
A thousand thousand to save,
A ring in chase of you; so did I abuse
A murd'rous guilt shows not itself more soon

A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.           Exit
A baubling vessel was he captain of,
A natural perspective, that is and is not.
A gentleman and follower of my lady's.
A most extracting frenzy of mine own
A solemn combination shall be made
A foolish thing was but a toy,
A great while ago the world begun,
A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had buried her grandam;
A journey to my loving Proteus.
A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears,
A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,
A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears;
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,
A man I am cross'd with adversity;
A linguist, and a man of such perfection
A slave that still an end turns me to shame!  
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful!
A smaller boon than this I cannot beg,
A MARINER
A GAOLER
A servant grafted in my serious trust,
A lip of much contempt, speeds from me;
A party in this alteration, finding
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril  
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
A federary with her, and one that knows
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
A school-boy's top. Away with her to prison.
A thriving issue; there is no lady living
A man, the worst about you.
A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door!
A most intelligencing bawd!
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence,
A just and open trial. While she lives,
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
A moiety of the throne, a great king's daughter,
A lady like me; with a love even such,
A lullaby too rough; I never saw
A merry heart goes all the day,
A ram and bleated; and the fire-rob'd god,
A way to make us better friends, more known.
A fair one are you- well you fit our ages
A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
A wave o' th' sea, that you might ever do
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepar'd
A place whereto you'll go?
A great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking on's teeth.
A saint-like sorrow. No fault could you make
A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
A graceful gentleman, against whose person,
A shepherd's daughter.
A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far-
A LOVER'S COMPLAINT
A plaintful story from a sist'ring vale,
A thousand favours from a maund she drew  
A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh,
A youthful suit- it was to gain my grace-
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,
A woman's gentle heart but not acquainted
A man in hue all hues in his controlling,
A dearer birth than this his love had brought
A loss in love that touches me more nearly.  
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,
A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
A third nor red, nor white, had stol'n of both,
A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
A god in love, to whom I am confined.
A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe,
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face,
A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
A dateless lively heat still to endure,

A WIDOW OF FLORENCE.
A mother, and a mistress, and a friend,
A phoenix, captain, and an enemy,
A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;  
A braving war.
A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
A native slip to us from foreign seeds.
A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
A senseless help, when help past sense we deem.
A modest one to bear me back again.
A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame,
A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
A poor physician's daughter-thou dislik'st
A lying trophy; and as oft is dumb
A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
A balance more replete.
A young man married is a man that's marr'd.
A very serious business calls on him.
A charge too heavy for my strength; but yet
A lover of thy drum, hater of love.                   Exeunt
A tucket afar off. Enter an old WIDOW OF FLORENCE, her daughter DIANA,
A shrewd turn, if she pleas'd.
A wife of me, though there my hope be done.
A stranger, no offender; and inform him
A SOOTHSAYER
A CLOWN
A little I can read.
A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
A man who is the abstract of all faults
A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
A space for farther travel.
A better ear. Menas, I did not think
A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense  
A blessed lottery to him.
A meaner than myself; since I myself
A cistern for scal'd snakes! Go, get thee hence.
A sennet sounded. Enter CAESAR, ANTONY, LEPIDUS,
A plain in Syria
A statue than a breather.
A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented
A soldier and his horse.
A plain near Actium
A most unnoble swerving.
A private man in Athens. This for him.
A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
A diminution in our captain's brain
A mangled shadow. Perchance to-morrow
A workman in't.
A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
A shrewd one to's.
A master-leaver and a fugitive!
A hill near Alexandria
A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
A forked mountain, or blue promontory
A million moe, now lost- she, Eros, has
A nobleness in record. But I will be
A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
A greater crack. The round world
A moiety of the world.
A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar:
A minister of her will; and it is great
A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly
A sun and moon, which kept their course and lighted
A benefit in this change; but if you seek
A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
A pair so famous. High events as these
A person representing HYMEN
A lawn before the DUKE'S palace
A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
A boar spear in my hand; and- in my heart
A thievish living on the common road?
A stubborn will to please,
A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and LORDS, like outlaws
A motley fool. A miserable world!  
A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
A scatt'red smile, and that I'll live upon.
A little riper and more lusty red
A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,
A sheep-cote fenc'd about with olive trees?
A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,
A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
A COURTEZAN
A hall in the DUKE'S palace
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
A mean woman was delivered
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
A man is master of his liberty;
A wretched soul, bruis'd with adversity,
A sunny look of his would soon repair.
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish.
A vulgar comment will be made of it,
A husband's office? Shall, Antipholus,
A public place
A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;
A wolf, nay worse, a fellow all in buff;
A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands
A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dry-foot well;
A chain, a chain. Do you not hear it ring?
A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
A nut, a cherry-stone;
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
A street
A street before a priory
A sin prevailing much in youthful men
A charitable duty of my order;
A most outrageous fit of madness took him,
A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,
A needy, hollow-ey'd, sharp-looking wretch,
A living dead man. This pernicious slave,

A CITIZEN of Antium  
A pretty tale. It may be you have heard it;
A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
A place below the first; for what miscarries
A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
A field of battle between the Roman and the Volscian camps
A bribe to pay my sword. I do refuse it,
A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius, Marcius!'
A flourish. Cornets. Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS bloody, with two or three soldiers
A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the

A sure destruction.
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
A sennet. Enter the PATRICIANS and the TRIBUNES
A little of that worthy work perform'd
A kinder value of the people than
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
A place of potency and sway o' th' state,
A fault on us, your tribunes, that we labour'd,
A man of their infirmity.
A noble life before a long, and wish
A foe to th' public weal. Obey, I charge thee,
A brand to th' end o' th' world.
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't;
A most inherent baseness.
A noble cunning. You were us'd to load me
A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
A highway between Rome and Antium
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
A worthy officer i' the war, but insolent,
A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
A trembling upon Rome, such as was never

A pair of tribunes that have wrack'd for Rome
A private whisper- no, not with such friends
A mother less, or granted less, Aufidius?
A better witness back than words, which we,
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
A city full; of tribunes such as you,
A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
A good construction. I rais'd him, and I pawn'd
A twist of rotten silk; never admitting
A FRENCH GENTLEMAN, friend to Philario
A ROMAN CAPTAIN
A sample to the youngest; to th' more mature
A glass that feated them; and to the graver
A child that guided dotards. To his mistress,
A year's age on me!
A seat for baseness.
A lustre to it.
A man worth any woman; overbuys me
A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
A drop of blood a day and, being aged,
A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect
A sly and constant knave,
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady
A Gallian girl at home. He furnaces
A saucy stranger in his court to mart  
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer  
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,
A pantler- not so eminent!
A second night of such sweet shortness which  
A pudency so rosy, the sweet view on't
A world by itself, and we will nothing pay
A riding suit, no costlier than would fit
A franklin's huswife.
A cell of ignorance, travelling abed,
A prison for a debtor that not dares
A pain that only seems to seek out danger
A storm, or robbery, call it what you will,
A look untender! If't be summer news,
A little witness my obedience. Look!
A strain of rareness; and I grieve myself
A man already.
A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.
A conduct overland to Milford Haven.
A thing more made of malice than of duty;
A dram of worth be drawn.
A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,
A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
A law-breaker, a villain. Yield thee, thief.
A headless man? The garments of Posthumus?
A very valiant Briton and a good,
A grave. Come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd
A fever with the absence of her son;
A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,
A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel
A very drudge of nature's, have subdu'd me
A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,  
A stop i' th' chaser, a retire; anon
A rout, confusion thick. Forthwith they fly,
A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.
A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again
A thing of pity.
A father to me; and thou hast created
A mother and two brothers. But, O scorn,
A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer.
A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,
A shop of all the qualities that man
A sacrilegious thief, to do't. The temple
A precious thing! I had it from the Queen.
A certain stuff, which, being ta'en would cease
A banish'd traitor.
A pair of worthier sons.
A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother
A Roman and a British ensign wave
A Gentleman, courtier.
A Priest.
A Norwegian Captain.
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
A sable silver'd.
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
A double blessing is a double grace;
A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends."
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up-  
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
A scullion!  
A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
A second time I kill my husband dead
A very, very- pajock.
A room in the Castle.
A brother's murther! Pray can I not,
A villain kills my father; and for that,
A rhapsody of words! Heaven's face doth glow;
A station like the herald Mercury
A combination and a form indeed
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
A noise within.
A noise within: 'Let her come in.'
A sister driven into desp'rate terms,
A face without a heart,'
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
A very noble youth. Mark.
A minist'ring angel shall my sister be
A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
A table and flagons of wine on it.  
A post from Wales, loaden with heavy news;
A thousand of his people butchered;
A gallant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not?
A son who is the theme of honour's tongue,
A pouncet box, which ever and anon
A plague upon it! it is in GIoucestershire-  
A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed,
A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
A gross fat man.
A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.
A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
A virtue that was never seen in you.
A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,
A couching lion and a ramping cat,
A good mouth-filling oath; and leave 'in sooth'
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
A mighty and a fearful head they are,
A comfort of retirement lives in this.
A larger dare to our great enterprise,
A public road near Coventry.
A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
A prodigy of fear, and a portent
A hare-brained Hotspur govern'd by a spleen.
A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,
A sword whose temper I intend to stain
A second time do such a courtesy.
A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;
A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear:
A very valiant rebel of the name.  
A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
A retreat is sounded.
A noble earl, and many a creature else
A gentleman well bred and of good name,
A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,
A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,
A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
A naked subject to the weeping clouds
A dozen captains stay at door for you.
A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?  
A certain instance that Glendower is dead.
A rotten case abides no handling.
A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,
A ragged and forestall'd remission.
A cup of wine, sir?
A cup of wine that's brisk and fine,
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,
A hundred alms-houses right well supplied;
A thousand pounds by th' year: thus runs the bill.
A fearful battle rend'red you in music.
A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'
A little cloth.
A night is but small breath and little pause
A city on th' inconstant billows dancing;
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,
A damned death!
A largess universal, like the sun,
A little touch of Harry in the night.
A good soft pillow for that good white head  
A lad of life, an imp of fame;
A very little little let us do,
A many of our bodies shall no doubt
A testament of noble-ending love.
A LAWYER
A FRENCH SERGEANT
A PORTER
A far more glorious star thy soul will make
A third thinks, without expense at all,
A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,
A holy maid hither with me I bring,
A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have plac'd;
A holy prophetess new risen up,
A woman clad in armour chaseth them.
A witch by fear, not force, like Hannibal,
A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear
A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd;
A second Hector, for his grim aspect
A thousand souls to death and deadly night.
A man of thy profession and degree;
A prophet to the fall of all our foes!
A braver soldier never couched lance,
A gentler heart did never sway in court;
A stouter champion never handled sword.
A letter was deliver'd to my hands,
A little herd of England's timorous deer,
A terrible and unavoided danger;
A field of battle
A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.
A man of great authority in France,
A goodly prize, fit for the devil's grace!
A virgin, and his servant, say to him.
A virgin from her tender infancy,
A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
A LIEUTENANT, a SHIPMASTER, a MASTER'S MATE, and WALTER WHITMORE  
A SPIRIT raised by him
A world of earthly blessings to my soul,
A day will come when York shall claim his own;
A spirit rais'd from depth of underground
A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!
A sorry breakfast for my Lord Protector.
A man that ne'er saw in his life before.
A hundred times and oft'ner, in my sleep,
A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,
A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.
A heart it was, bound in with diamonds-
A wilderness is populous enough,
A cunning man did calculate my birth  
A Roman sworder and banditto slave
A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul
A poor esquire of Kent that loves his king.
A NOBLEMAN                         TWO KEEPERS
A HUNTSMAN
A SON that has killed his father
A FATHER that has killed his son
A woman's general; what should we fear?  
A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'  
A bird that will revenge upon you all;
A crown for York!-and, lords, bow low to him.
A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire
A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day
A field of battle between Towton and Saxton, in Yorkshire
A loud alarum. Enter CLIFFORD, wounded
A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.
A chase in the north of England
A man at least, for less I should not be;
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
A cold premeditation for my purpose!
A plain in Warwickshire
A park near Middleham Castle in Yorkshire
A salve for any sore that may betide.
A parley, sirrah, to George of Clarence.
A field of battle near Barnet
A CRIER
A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
A man may weep upon his wedding-day.
A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys  
A place next to the King.
A new hell in himself.
A most poor issue?
A thing inspir'd, and, not consulting, broke
A minister in his power. You know his nature,
A full hot horse, who being allow'd his way,
A noise within, crying 'Room for the Queen!'
A single voice; and that not pass'd me but
A trembling contribution! Why, we take  
A fit or two o' th' face; but they are shrewd ones;
A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.
A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong  
A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;
A good digestion to you all; and once more
A noble company! What are their pleasures?
A thousand thanks, and pray 'em take their pleasures.
A little happier than my wretched father;
A most unnatural and faithless service.
A strong faith to conceal it.
A buzzing of a separation
A woman of less place might ask by law-
A thousand pound a year, annual support,
A very fresh-fish here-fie, fie, fie upon
A thousand pounds a year for pure respect!  
A prince most prudent, of an excellent
A year before. It is not to be question'd  
A better wife, let him in nought be trusted
A royal lady, spake one the least word that might
A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and
A strange tongue makes my cause more strange, suspicious;
A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?
A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,
A soul as even as a calm. Pray think us
A creature of the Queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'
A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain
A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to
A loyal and obedient subject is
A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune,
A league between his Highness and Ferrara.
A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,
A peace above all earthly dignities,
A still and quiet conscience. The King has cur'd me,
A load would sink a navy-too much honour.
A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.
A street in Westminster
A distance from her, while her Grace sat down
A man in much esteem with th' King, and truly
A worthy friend. The King has made him Master
A gentleman, sent from the King, to see you.
A right good husband, let him be a noble;
A queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.
A most arch heretic, a pestilence  
A quiet night, and my good mistress will  
A man of his place, and so near our favour,
A Council table brought in, with chairs and stools, and placed
A man that more detests, more stirs against,
A shrewd turn and he's your friend for ever.'
A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.
A pattern to all princes living with her,
A most unspotted lily shall she pass
A soldier by the honour-giving hand
A half-fac'd groat five hundred pound a year!
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
A foot of honour better than I was;
A will that bars the title of thy son.
A woman's will; a cank'red grandam's will!
A peaceful progress to the ocean.
A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,
A widow, husbandless, subject to fears;
A woman, naturally born to fears;
A widow cries: Be husband to me, heavens!
A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear
A mother's curse-on her revolting son.
A chafed lion by the mortal paw,
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
A rage whose heat hath this condition
A passion hateful to my purposes;
A whole armado of convicted sail
A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,
A fearful eye thou hast; where is that blood
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
A thousand businesses are brief in hand,  
A cock'red silken wanton, brave our fields
A voluntary zeal and an unurg'd faith
A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
A Soothsayer
A Poet
A public place.
A wretched creature and must bend his body
A man of such a feeble temper should
A street. Thunder and lightning.
A man no mightier than thyself or me
A shrewd contriver; and you know his means,
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.
A woman well reputed, Cato's daughter.
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
A street near the Capitol.
A crowd of people, among them Artemidorus and the Soothsayer.
A Hail, Caesar! Read this schedule.
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
A street.
A house in Rome. Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus, seated at a table.
A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds
A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,
A little from this ground.
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
A canopy most fatal, under which
A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend.
A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe,
A Captain under Edmund's command.
A Herald.
A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
A credulous father! and a brother noble,
A little to disquantity your train,
A babe to honour her! If she must teem,  
A fox when one has caught her,
A court within the Castle of the Earl of Gloucester.
A childlike office.
A plague upon your epileptic visage!  
A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
A good man's fortune may grow out at heels.
A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle  
A heath.
A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.
A farmhouse near Gloucester's Castle.
A mistress's command. Wear this.          [Gives a favour.]
A father, and a gracious aged man,
A man, a prince, by him so benefited!  
A woman's shape doth shield thee.
A troop of horse with felt. I'll put't in proof,  
A plot upon her virtuous husband's life,
A drum afar off.
A tent in the French camp.
A field between the two camps.
A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'no,'
A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.
A FORESTER
A mild of grace and complete majesty-
A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
A man of complements, whom right and wrong
A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.
A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red.
A man of sovereign parts, peerless esteem'd,
A hundred thousand more, in surety of the which,
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast,
A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
A domineering pedant o'er the boy,
A woman, that is like a German clock,
A whitely wanton with a velvet brow,
A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.
A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
A green goose a goddess- pure, pure idolatry.
A caudle, ho!
A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,  
A leg, a limb-
A true man or a thief that gallops so?
A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
A wife of such wood were felicity.
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind.
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
A huge translation of hypocrisy,
A better speech was never spoke before.
A mean most meanly; and in ushering,
A world of torments though I should endure,
A mess of Russians left us but of late.
A man so breathed that certain he would fight ye,
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue.
A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,
A wife?
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
A Scottish Doctor
A Sergeant
A Porter
A desert place. Thunder and lightning.
A camp near Forres. Alarum within.
A heath. Thunder.
A prosperous gentleman; and to be King  
A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
A limbeck only. When in swinish sleep
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
A bell rings.
A little water clears us of this deed.
A fellow to it.
A falcon towering in her pride of place
A deed of dreadful note.
A park near the palace.
A Hall in the palace. A banquet prepared.
A woman's story at a winter's fire,
A heath. Thunder.
A cavern. In the middle, a boiling cauldron. Thunder.
A show of eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand;
A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
A stanchless avarice that, were I King,
A most miraculous work in this good King,
A modern ecstasy. The dead man's knell
AARON, a Moor, beloved by Tamora
AARON. Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,
AARON.  [Aside]  Clubs, clubs! These lovers will not keep the
AARON.  [Coming forward]  Why, how now, lords!
AARON. Away, I say!
AARON. Why, are ye mad, or know ye not in Rome
AARON. To achieve her- how?
AARON.  [Aside]  Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.
AARON. Why, then, it seems some certain snatch or so
AARON. Would you had hit it too!
AARON. For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar.
AARON. He that had wit would think that I had none,
AARON. Madam, though Venus govern your desires,
AARON. No more, great Empress: Bassianus comes.
AARON. Come on, my lords, the better foot before;
AARON.  [Aside]  Now will I fetch the King to find them here,
AARON. My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.
AARON. Titus Andronicus, my lord the Emperor
AARON. Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
AARON.  [Aside]  If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest,
AARON. I go, Andronicus; and for thy hand
AARON. Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.
AARON. Ay, just- a verse in Horace. Right, you have it.
AARON. Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?
AARON. Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.
AARON.  [Aside]  Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.
AARON. Well, more or less, or ne'er a whit at all,
AARON. Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!
AARON. To whom?
AARON. Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?
AARON. Why, then she is the devil's dam;
AARON. Zounds, ye whore! Is black so base a hue?
AARON. That which thou canst not undo.
AARON. Villain, I have done thy mother.
AARON. It shall not die.
AARON. What, must it, nurse? Then let no man but I
AARON. Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.  
AARON. My mistress is my mistress: this my self,
AARON. Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:
AARON. Then sit we down and let us all consult.
AARON. Why, so, brave lords! When we join in league
AARON. The Emperess, the midwife, and yourself.
AARON. O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy.
AARON. Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies,
AARON. Touch not the boy, he is of royal blood.
AARON. Lucius, save the child,
AARON. An if it please thee! Why, assure thee, Lucius,
AARON. Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.
AARON. What if I do not? as indeed I do not;
AARON. First know thou, I begot him on the Empress.
AARON. Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity
AARON. Why, she was wash'd, and cut, and trimm'd, and 'twas
AARON. Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them.
AARON. Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.
AARON. Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
AARON. If there be devils, would I were a devil,
AARON. Some devil whisper curses in my ear,
AARON. Ah, why should wrath be mute and fury dumb?

ABBESS. How long hath this possession held the man?
ABBESS. Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?
ABBESS. You should for that have reprehended him.
ABBESS. Ay, but not rough enough.
ABBESS. Haply in private.
ABBESS. Ay, but not enough.

ABBESS. No, not a creature enters in my house.
ABBESS. Neither; he took this place for sanctuary,

ABHORSON. Do you call, sir?
ABHORSON. A bawd, sir? Fie upon him! He will discredit our mystery.
ABHORSON. Ay, sir; a mystery.
ABHORSON. Sir, it is a mystery.
ABHORSON. Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be too
ABHORSON. Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.
ABHORSON. Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.
ABHORSON. What ho, Barnardine!
ABHORSON. Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.
ABHORSON. Go in to him, and fetch him out.
ABHORSON. Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?  
ABHORSON. Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your prayers;
ABHORSON. Look you, sir, here comes your ghostly father.

ACHILLES. Well! why, so I do.
ACHILLES. I know that, fool.
ACHILLES. What?
ACHILLES. Nay, good Ajax.
ACHILLES. Nay, I must hold you.
ACHILLES. Peace, fool.
ACHILLES. Will you set your wit to a fool's?
ACHILLES. What's the quarrel?
ACHILLES. Your last service was suff'rance; 'twas not voluntary. No
ACHILLES. What, with me too, Thersites?
ACHILLES. What, what?
ACHILLES. There's for you, Patroclus.

ACHILLES and PATROCLUS stand in their tent
ACHILLES. What comes the general to speak with me?
ACHILLES. No.
ACHILLES. Good day, good day.
ACHILLES. What, does the cuckold scorn me?
ACHILLES. Good morrow, Ajax.
ACHILLES. Good morrow.
ACHILLES. What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?  
ACHILLES. What, am I poor of late?
ACHILLES. What are you reading?
ACHILLES. This is not strange, Ulysses.
ACHILLES. I do believe it; for they pass'd by me
ACHILLES. Of this my privacy
ACHILLES. Ha! known!
ACHILLES. Shall Ajax fight with Hector?
ACHILLES. I see my reputation is at stake;
ACHILLES. Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus.
ACHILLES. What?
ACHILLES. How so?
ACHILLES. How can that be?
ACHILLES. Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.
ACHILLES. To him, Patroclus. Tell him I humbly desire the valiant
ACHILLES. Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?
ACHILLES. Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.

ACHILLES. A maiden battle then? O, I perceive you!
ACHILLES. I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!
ACHILLES. I am Achilles.
ACHILLES. Behold thy fill.  
ACHILLES. Thou art too brief. I will the second time,
ACHILLES. Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body
ACHILLES. I tell thee yea.
ACHILLES. Dost thou entreat me, Hector?

ACHILLES. I'll heat his blood with Greekish wine to-night,
ACHILLES. How now, thou core of envy!
ACHILLES. From whence, fragment?
ACHILLES. My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite

ADAM. O unhappy youth!  
ADAM. No matter whither, so you come not here.

ADRIANA, wife to Antipholus of Ephesus
ADRIANA. Neither my husband nor the slave return'd
ADRIANA. Why should their liberty than ours be more?
ADRIANA. Look when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
ADRIANA. There's none but asses will be bridled so.
ADRIANA. This servitude makes you to keep unwed.
ADRIANA. But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.
ADRIANA. How if your husband start some other where?
ADRIANA. Patience unmov'd! no marvel though she pause:
ADRIANA. Say, is your tardy master now at hand?
ADRIANA. Say, didst thou speak with him? Know'st thou his mind?
ADRIANA. But say, I prithee, is he coming home?
ADRIANA. Horn-mad, thou villain!
ADRIANA. Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.
ADRIANA. Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.
ADRIANA. Hence, prating peasant! Fetch thy master home.
ADRIANA. His company must do his minions grace,
ADRIANA. Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
ADRIANA. Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown.
ADRIANA. By thee; and this thou didst return from him-
ADRIANA. How ill agrees it with your gravity
ADRIANA. Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
ADRIANA. Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.
ADRIANA.  [Within]  Who is that at the door, that keeps all this noise?
ADRIANA.  [Within]  Your wife, sir knave! Go get you from the door.
ADRIANA. Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
ADRIANA. He meant he did me none-the more my spite.
ADRIANA. And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.
ADRIANA. And what said he?
ADRIANA. With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?
ADRIANA. Didst speak him fair?
ADRIANA. I cannot, nor I will not hold me still;
ADRIANA. Ah, but I think him better than I say,
ADRIANA. Where is thy master, Dromio? Is he well?
ADRIANA. Why, man, what is the matter?
ADRIANA. What, is he arrested? Tell me, at whose suit?
ADRIANA. Go fetch it, sister.  [Exit LUCIANA]  This I wonder at:
ADRIANA. What, the chain?
ADRIANA. The hours come back! That did I never hear.
ADRIANA. As if Time were in debt! How fondly dost thou reason!
ADRIANA. Go, Dromio, there's the money; bear it straight,
ADRIANA. His incivility confirms no less.
ADRIANA. O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!
ADRIANA. O husband, God doth know you din'd at home,
ADRIANA. Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?
ADRIANA. Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
ADRIANA. He came to me, and I deliver'd it.
ADRIANA. I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.
ADRIANA. Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
ADRIANA. O, bind him, bind him; let him not come near me.
ADRIANA. What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
ADRIANA. I will discharge thee ere I go from thee;
ADRIANA. Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.
ADRIANA. I know the man. What is the sum he owes?
ADRIANA. Say, how grows it due?
ADRIANA. He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.
ADRIANA. It may be so, but I did never see it.
ADRIANA. And come with naked swords.
ADRIANA. Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! He is mad.
ADRIANA. To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
ADRIANA. This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
ADRIANA. To none of these, except it be the last;
ADRIANA. Why, so I did.
ADRIANA. As roughly as my modesty would let me.
ADRIANA. And in assemblies too.
ADRIANA. It was the copy of our conference.
ADRIANA. She did betray me to my own reproof.
ADRIANA. Then let your servants bring my husband forth.
ADRIANA. I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
ADRIANA. I will not hence and leave my husband here;
ADRIANA. Come, go; I will fall prostrate at his feet,
ADRIANA. Justice, most sacred Duke, against the Abbess!
ADRIANA. May it please your Grace, Antipholus, my husband,
ADRIANA. Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,
ADRIANA. Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you
ADRIANA. No, my good lord. Myself, he, and my sister,
ADRIANA. I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.
ADRIANA. Which of you two did dine with me to-day?
ADRIANA. And are not you my husband?
ADRIANA. I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,
ADRIAN, a Volscian
ADRIAN
ADRIAN. Though this island seem to be desert-  
ADRIAN. Uninhabitable, and almost inaccessible-
ADRIAN. Yet-
ADRIAN. It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate
ADRIAN. The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
ADRIAN. Tunis was never grac'd before with such a paragon
ADRIAN. 'Widow Dido' said you? You make me study of
ADRIAN. Carthage?
ADRIAN. Follow, I pray you.                             Exeunt

ADRIANA. Go, Dromio, there's the money; bear it straight,
ADRIANA. His incivility confirms no less.
ADRIANA. O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!
ADRIANA. O husband, God doth know you din'd at home,
ADRIANA. Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?
ADRIANA. Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
ADRIANA. He came to me, and I deliver'd it.
ADRIANA. I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.
ADRIANA. Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
ADRIANA. O, bind him, bind him; let him not come near me.
ADRIANA. What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
ADRIANA. I will discharge thee ere I go from thee;
ADRIANA. Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.
ADRIANA. I know the man. What is the sum he owes?
ADRIANA. Say, how grows it due?
ADRIANA. He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.
ADRIANA. It may be so, but I did never see it.
ADRIANA. And come with naked swords.
ADRIANA. Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! He is mad.
ADRIANA. To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
ADRIANA. This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
ADRIANA. To none of these, except it be the last;
ADRIANA. Why, so I did.
ADRIANA. As roughly as my modesty would let me.
ADRIANA. And in assemblies too.
ADRIANA. It was the copy of our conference.
ADRIANA. She did betray me to my own reproof.
ADRIANA. Then let your servants bring my husband forth.
ADRIANA. I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
ADRIANA. I will not hence and leave my husband here;
ADRIANA. Come, go; I will fall prostrate at his feet,
ADRIANA. Justice, most sacred Duke, against the Abbess!
ADRIANA. May it please your Grace, Antipholus, my husband,
ADRIANA. Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,
ADRIANA. Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you
ADRIANA. No, my good lord. Myself, he, and my sister,
ADRIANA. I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.
ADRIANA. Which of you two did dine with me to-day?
ADRIANA. And are not you my husband?
ADRIANA. I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,
ADRIAN, a Volscian
ADRIAN
ADRIAN. Though this island seem to be desert-  
ADRIAN. Uninhabitable, and almost inaccessible-
ADRIAN. Yet-
ADRIAN. It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate
ADRIAN. The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
ADRIAN. Tunis was never grac'd before with such a paragon
ADRIAN. 'Widow Dido' said you? You make me study of
ADRIAN. Carthage?
ADRIAN. Follow, I pray you.                             Exeunt
ADAM,   servant to Oliver
ADAM. Yonder comes my master, your brother.
ADAM. [Coming forward] Sweet masters, be patient; for your father's
ADAM. Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in
ADAM. What, my young master? O my gentle master!
ADAM. O unhappy youth!  
ADAM. No matter whither, so you come not here.
ADAM. But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
ADAM. Master, go on; and I will follow the
ADAM. Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food! Here lie
ADAM. So had you need;
ADRIANA, wife to Antipholus of Ephesus
ADRIANA. Neither my husband nor the slave return'd
ADRIANA. Why should their liberty than ours be more?
ADRIANA. Look when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
ADRIANA. There's none but asses will be bridled so.
ADRIANA. This servitude makes you to keep unwed.
ADRIANA. But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.
ADRIANA. How if your husband start some other where?
ADRIANA. Patience unmov'd! no marvel though she pause:
ADRIANA. Say, is your tardy master now at hand?
ADRIANA. Say, didst thou speak with him? Know'st thou his mind?
ADRIANA. But say, I prithee, is he coming home?
ADRIANA. Horn-mad, thou villain!
ADRIANA. Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.
ADRIANA. Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.
ADRIANA. Hence, prating peasant! Fetch thy master home.
ADRIANA. His company must do his minions grace,
ADRIANA. Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
ADRIANA. Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown.
ADRIANA. By thee; and this thou didst return from him-
ADRIANA. How ill agrees it with your gravity
ADRIANA. Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
ADRIANA. Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.
ADRIANA.  [Within]  Who is that at the door, that keeps all this noise?
ADRIANA.  [Within]  Your wife, sir knave! Go get you from the door.
ADRIANA. Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
ADRIANA. He meant he did me none-the more my spite.
ADRIANA. And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.
ADRIANA. And what said he?
ADRIANA. With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?
ADRIANA. Didst speak him fair?
ADRIANA. I cannot, nor I will not hold me still;
ADRIANA. Ah, but I think him better than I say,
ADRIANA. Where is thy master, Dromio? Is he well?
ADRIANA. Why, man, what is the matter?
ADRIANA. What, is he arrested? Tell me, at whose suit?
ADRIANA. Go fetch it, sister.  [Exit LUCIANA]  This I wonder at:
ADRIANA. What, the chain?
ADRIANA. The hours come back! That did I never hear.
ADRIANA. As if Time were in debt! How fondly dost thou reason!
ADRIANA. Go, Dromio, there's the money; bear it straight,

ADRIANA. What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
ADRIANA. I will discharge thee ere I go from thee;
ADRIANA. Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.
ADRIANA. I know the man. What is the sum he owes?
ADRIANA. Say, how grows it due?
ADRIANA. He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.
ADRIANA. It may be so, but I did never see it.
ADRIANA. And come with naked swords.
ADRIANA. Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! He is mad.
ADRIANA. To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
ADRIANA. This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
ADRIANA. To none of these, except it be the last;
ADRIANA. Why, so I did.
ADRIANA. As roughly as my modesty would let me.
ADRIANA. And in assemblies too.
ADRIANA. It was the copy of our conference.
ADRIANA. She did betray me to my own reproof.
ADRIANA. Then let your servants bring my husband forth.
ADRIANA. I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
ADRIANA. I will not hence and leave my husband here;
ADRIANA. Come, go; I will fall prostrate at his feet,
ADRIANA. Justice, most sacred Duke, against the Abbess!
ADRIANA. May it please your Grace, Antipholus, my husband,
ADRIANA. Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,
ADRIANA. Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you
ADRIANA. No, my good lord. Myself, he, and my sister,
ADRIANA. I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.
ADRIANA. Which of you two did dine with me to-day?
ADRIANA. And are not you my husband?
ADRIANA. I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,
ADRIAN, a Volscian
ADRIAN
ADRIAN. Though this island seem to be desert-  
ADRIAN. Uninhabitable, and almost inaccessible-
ADRIAN. Yet-
ADRIAN. It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate
ADRIAN. The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
ADRIAN. Tunis was never grac'd before with such a paragon
ADRIAN. 'Widow Dido' said you? You make me study of
ADRIAN. Carthage?
ADRIAN. Follow, I pray you.                             Exeunt
ADAM,   servant to Oliver
ADAM. Yonder comes my master, your brother.
ADAM. [Coming forward] Sweet masters, be patient; for your father's
ADAM. Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in
ADAM. What, my young master? O my gentle master!
ADAM. O unhappy youth!  
ADAM. No matter whither, so you come not here.
ADAM. But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
ADAM. Master, go on; and I will follow the
ADAM. Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food! Here lie
ADAM. So had you need;
ADRIANA, wife to Antipholus of Ephesus
ADRIANA. Neither my husband nor the slave return'd
ADRIANA. Why should their liberty than ours be more?
ADRIANA. Look when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
ADRIANA. There's none but asses will be bridled so.
ADRIANA. This servitude makes you to keep unwed.
ADRIANA. But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.
ADRIANA. How if your husband start some other where?
ADRIANA. Patience unmov'd! no marvel though she pause:
ADRIANA. Say, is your tardy master now at hand?
ADRIANA. Say, didst thou speak with him? Know'st thou his mind?
ADRIANA. But say, I prithee, is he coming home?
ADRIANA. Horn-mad, thou villain!
ADRIANA. Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.
ADRIANA. Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.
ADRIANA. Hence, prating peasant! Fetch thy master home.
ADRIANA. His company must do his minions grace,
ADRIANA. Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
ADRIANA. Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown.
ADRIANA. By thee; and this thou didst return from him-
ADRIANA. How ill agrees it with your gravity
ADRIANA. Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
ADRIANA. Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.
ADRIANA.  [Within]  Who is that at the door, that keeps all this noise?
ADRIANA.  [Within]  Your wife, sir knave! Go get you from the door.
ADRIANA. Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
ADRIANA. He meant he did me none-the more my spite.
ADRIANA. And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.
ADRIANA. And what said he?
ADRIANA. With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?
ADRIANA. Didst speak him fair?
ADRIANA. I cannot, nor I will not hold me still;
ADRIANA. Ah, but I think him better than I say,
ADRIANA. Where is thy master, Dromio? Is he well?
ADRIANA. Why, man, what is the matter?
ADRIANA. What, is he arrested? Tell me, at whose suit?
ADRIANA. Go fetch it, sister.  [Exit LUCIANA]  This I wonder at:
ADRIANA. What, the chain?
ADRIANA. The hours come back! That did I never hear.
ADRIANA. As if Time were in debt! How fondly dost thou reason!
ADRIANA. Go, Dromio, there's the money; bear it straight,
ADRIANA. His incivility confirms no less.
ADRIANA. O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!
ADRIANA. O husband, God doth know you din'd at home,
ADRIANA. Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?
ADRIANA. Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
ADRIANA. He came to me, and I deliver'd it.
ADRIANA. I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.
ADRIANA. Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
ADRIANA. O, bind him, bind him; let him not come near me.
ADRIANA. What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
ADRIANA. I will discharge thee ere I go from thee;
ADRIANA. Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.
ADRIANA. I know the man. What is the sum he owes?

AEGEON. Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,

AEGEON. A heavier task could not have been impos'd
AEGEON. O, had the gods done so, I had not now
AEGEON. My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
AEGEON. Hopeless and helpless doth Aegeon wend,
AEGEON. Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,
AEGEON. Most mighty Duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:
AEGEON. Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?
AEGEON. I am sure you both of you remember me.
AEGEON. Why look you strange on me? You know me well.
AEGEON. O! grief hath chang'd me since you saw me last;
AEGEON. Dromio, nor thou?
AEGEON. I am sure thou dost.
AEGEON. Not know my voice! O time's extremity,
AEGEON. But seven years since, in Syracuse, boy,
AEGEON. If I dream not, thou art Aemilia.

AGUECHEEK. Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary put

AGUECHEEK. I have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reason good

AGUECHEEK. And your horse now would make him an ass.
AGUECHEEK. O, 'twill be admirable!
AGUECHEEK. Before me, she's a good wench.
AGUECHEEK. I was ador'd once too.  
AGUECHEEK. If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.

AGUECHEEK. Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the Count's

AGAMEMNON. Why will he not, upon our fair request,
AGAMEMNON. Let Ajax go to him.
AGAMEMNON. O, no, you shall not go.
AGAMEMNON. [Aside] He will be the physician that should be the  
AGAMEMNON. Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep.
AGAMEMNON. What wouldst thou of us, Troyan? Make demand.
AGAMEMNON. Let Diomedes bear him,
AGAMEMNON. We'll execute your purpose, and put on

AGAMEMNON. The better.
AGAMEMNON. Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,
AGAMEMNON. Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas' daughter?
AGAMEMNON. Is this the lady Cressid?
AGAMEMNON. Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.
AGAMEMNON. Yonder comes the troop.
AGAMEMNON. Which way would Hector have it?
AGAMEMNON. Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,
AGAMEMNON. What Troyan is that same that looks so heavy?
AGAMEMNON. They are in action.
AGAMEMNON. His blows are well dispos'd. There, Ajax!
AGAMEMNON and the rest of the Greeks come forward
AGAMEMNON.Worthy all arms! as welcome as to one
AGAMEMNON. [To Troilus] My well-fam'd lord of Troy, no less to you.
AGAMEMNON. First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;  
AGAMEMNON. We go wrong, we go wrong.
AGAMEMNON. So now, fair Prince of Troy, I bid good night;
AGAMEMNON. Good night.
AGAMEMNON. Renew, renew! The fierce Polydamus
AGAMEMNON. Hark! hark! what shout is this?
AGAMEMNON. March patiently along. Let one be sent
AGUECHEEK. Sir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch!
AGUECHEEK. Bless you, fair shrew.
AGUECHEEK. What's that?
AGUECHEEK. Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.
AGUECHEEK. Good Mistress Mary Accost-
AGUECHEEK. By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company.
AGUECHEEK. An you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw
AGUECHEEK. Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.
AGUECHEEK. Wherefore, sweetheart? What's your metaphor?
AGUECHEEK. Why, I think so; I am not such an ass but I can keep my

AGUECHEEK. Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary put
AGUECHEEK. An I thought that, I'd forswear it. I'll ride home  
AGUECHEEK. What is 'pourquoi'- do or not do? I would I had bestowed
AGUECHEEK. Why, would that have mended my hair?
AGUECHEEK. But it becomes me well enough, does't not?
AGUECHEEK. Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby. Your niece will

AGUECHEEK. As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the

AGUECHEEK. And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as

AGUECHEEK. Nay, by my troth, I know not; but I know to be up late
AGUECHEEK. Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consists of

AGUECHEEK. By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I had

AGUECHEEK. An you love me, let's do't. I am dog at a catch.
AGUECHEEK. Most certain. Let our catch be 'Thou knave.'

AGUECHEEK. I was ador'd once too.  
AGUECHEEK. If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.
AGUECHEEK. If I do not, never trust me; take it how you will.
AGUECHEEK. And we do not, it is pity of our lives.
AGUECHEEK. 'Slight, I could so beat the rogue-

AGUECHEEK. So could I too.

AGUECHEEK. 'Odours,' 'pregnant,' and 'vouchsafed'- I'll get 'em all
AGUECHEEK. No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.
AGUECHEEK. Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the Count's
AGUECHEEK. As plain as I see you now.
AGUECHEEK. 'Slight! will you make an ass o' me?

AGUECHEEK. Marry, will I, sir; and for that I promis'd you, I'll be
AGUECHEEK. 'Slid, I'll after him again and beat him.
AGUECHEEK. And I do not-                                  Exit
AGUECHEEK. Now, sir, have I met you again?
AGUECHEEK. Nay, let him alone. I'll go another way to work with
AGUECHEEK. For the love of God, a surgeon!
AGUECHEEK. Has broke my head across, and has given Sir Toby a

AGUECHEEK. I'll help you, Sir Toby, because we'll be dress'd

AGRIPPA. Give me leave, Caesar.
AGRIPPA. Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,

AGRIPPA. There she appear'd indeed! Or my reporter devis'd well for
AGRIPPA. O, rare for Antony!
AGRIPPA. Rare Egyptian!
AGRIPPA. Royal wench!
AGRIPPA. Let us go.
AGRIPPA. Sir, Mark Antony
AGRIPPA. What, are the brothers parted?
AGRIPPA. 'Tis a noble Lepidus.
AGRIPPA. Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
AGRIPPA. What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
AGRIPPA. O, Antony! O thou Arabian bird!
AGRIPPA. Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
AGRIPPA. Both he loves.
AGRIPPA. Good fortune, worthy soldier, and farewell.
AGRIPPA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in's face.
AGRIPPA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,
AGRIPPA. Who, queasy with his insolence
AGRIPPA. Who does he accuse?
AGRIPPA. Sir, this should be answer'd.
AGRIPPA. Welcome, lady.
AGRIPPA. Caesar, I shall.                                 Exit

AGAMEMNON. This Troyan scorns us, or the men of Troy
AGAMEMNON. Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself Aeneas?
AGAMEMNON. What's your affair, I pray you?
AGAMEMNON. He hears nought privately that comes from Troy.
AGAMEMNON. Speak frankly as the wind;

AGAMEMNON. Fair Lord Aeneas, let me touch your hand;
AGAMEMNON. Where is Achilles?
AGAMEMNON. Let it be known to him that we are here.
AGAMEMNON. Hear you, Patroclus.
AGAMEMNON. In second voice we'll not be satisfied;
AGAMEMNON. No more than what he thinks he is.
AGAMEMNON. No question.

AGRIPPA. Sir, Mark Antony
AGRIPPA. What, are the brothers parted?
AGRIPPA. 'Tis a noble Lepidus.
AGRIPPA. Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
AGRIPPA. What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
AGRIPPA. O, Antony! O thou Arabian bird!
AGRIPPA. Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
AGRIPPA. Both he loves.
AGRIPPA. Good fortune, worthy soldier, and farewell.
AGRIPPA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in's face.
AGRIPPA. [Aside to ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,

AGAMEMNON. What would you fore our tent?
AGAMEMNON. Even this.
AGAMEMNON. With surety stronger than Achilles' an
AGAMEMNON. How?
AGAMEMNON. This Troyan scorns us, or the men of Troy
AGAMEMNON. Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself Aeneas?
AGAMEMNON. What's your affair, I pray you?
AGAMEMNON. He hears nought privately that comes from Troy.
AGAMEMNON. Speak frankly as the wind;
AGAMEMNON. This shall be told our lovers, Lord Aeneas.
AGAMEMNON. Fair Lord Aeneas, let me touch your hand;
AGAMEMNON. Where is Achilles?
AGAMEMNON. Let it be known to him that we are here.
AGAMEMNON. Hear you, Patroclus.
AGAMEMNON. In second voice we'll not be satisfied;
AGAMEMNON. No more than what he thinks he is.
AGAMEMNON. No question.
AGAMEMNON. No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as wise,
AGAMEMNON. Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the
AGAMEMNON. What's his excuse?
AGAMEMNON. Why will he not, upon our fair request,
AGAMEMNON. Let Ajax go to him.
AGAMEMNON. O, no, you shall not go.
AGAMEMNON. [Aside] He will be the physician that should be the  
AGAMEMNON. Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep.
AGAMEMNON. What wouldst thou of us, Troyan? Make demand.
AGAMEMNON. Let Diomedes bear him,

AGAMEMNON. Yonder comes the troop.
AGAMEMNON. Which way would Hector have it?
AGAMEMNON. Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,
AGAMEMNON. What Troyan is that same that looks so heavy?

AGAMEMNON and the rest of the Greeks come forward
AGAMEMNON.Worthy all arms! as welcome as to one

AGAMEMNON. First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;  
AGAMEMNON. We go wrong, we go wrong.
AGAMEMNON. So now, fair Prince of Troy, I bid good night;
AGAMEMNON. Good night.
AGAMEMNON. Renew, renew! The fierce Polydamus
AGAMEMNON. Hark! hark! what shout is this?
AGAMEMNON. March patiently along. Let one be sent
AGUECHEEK. Sir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch!
AGUECHEEK. Bless you, fair shrew.
AGUECHEEK. What's that?
AGUECHEEK. Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.
AGUECHEEK. Good Mistress Mary Accost-
AGUECHEEK. By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company.
AGUECHEEK. An you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw
AGUECHEEK. Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.
AGUECHEEK. Wherefore, sweetheart? What's your metaphor?
AGUECHEEK. Why, I think so; I am not such an ass but I can keep my
AGUECHEEK. Are you full of them?
AGUECHEEK. Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary put
AGUECHEEK. An I thought that, I'd forswear it. I'll ride home  
AGUECHEEK. What is 'pourquoi'- do or not do? I would I had bestowed
AGUECHEEK. Why, would that have mended my hair?
AGUECHEEK. But it becomes me well enough, does't not?
AGUECHEEK. Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby. Your niece will
AGUECHEEK. I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' th' strangest
AGUECHEEK. As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the
AGUECHEEK. Faith, I can cut a caper.
AGUECHEEK. And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as
AGUECHEEK. Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in
AGUECHEEK. Taurus? That's sides and heart.  
AGUECHEEK. Nay, by my troth, I know not; but I know to be up late
AGUECHEEK. Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consists of
AGUECHEEK. Here comes the fool, i' faith.
AGUECHEEK. By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I had
AGUECHEEK. Excellent! Why, this is the best fooling, when all is
AGUECHEEK. There's a testril of me too; if one knight give a-
AGUECHEEK. Ay, ay; I care not for good life.
AGUECHEEK. Excellent good, i' faith!
AGUECHEEK. A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.  
AGUECHEEK. Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.
AGUECHEEK. An you love me, let's do't. I am dog at a catch.
AGUECHEEK. Most certain. Let our catch be 'Thou knave.'
AGUECHEEK. 'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to call
AGUECHEEK. Good, i' faith! Come, begin.           [Catch sung]
AGUECHEEK. Ay, he does well enough if he be dispos'd, and so do I
AGUECHEEK. 'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's ahungry,
AGUECHEEK. O, if I thought that, I'd beat him like a dog.
AGUECHEEK. I have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reason good
AGUECHEEK. I have't in my nose too.
AGUECHEEK. And your horse now would make him an ass.
AGUECHEEK. O, 'twill be admirable!
AGUECHEEK. Before me, she's a good wench.
AGUECHEEK. I was ador'd once too.  
AGUECHEEK. If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.
AGUECHEEK. If I do not, never trust me; take it how you will.
AGUECHEEK. And we do not, it is pity of our lives.
AGUECHEEK. 'Slight, I could so beat the rogue-
AGUECHEEK. Pistol him, pistol him.
AGUECHEEK. Fie on him, Jezebel!
AGUECHEEK. That's me, I warrant you.
AGUECHEEK. I knew 'twas I; for many do call me fool.
AGUECHEEK. Her C's, her U's, and her T's. Why that?
AGUECHEEK. So could I too.
AGUECHEEK. Nor I neither.
AGUECHEEK. Or o' mine either?
AGUECHEEK. I' faith, or I either?
AGUECHEEK. I'll make one too.                           Exeunt
AGUECHEEK. Dieu vous garde, monsieur.
AGUECHEEK. I hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.
AGUECHEEK. That youth's a rare courtier- 'Rain odours' well!
AGUECHEEK. 'Odours,' 'pregnant,' and 'vouchsafed'- I'll get 'em all
AGUECHEEK. No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.
AGUECHEEK. Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the Count's
AGUECHEEK. As plain as I see you now.
AGUECHEEK. 'Slight! will you make an ass o' me?
AGUECHEEK. An't be any way, it must be with valour, for policy I
AGUECHEEK. Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?
AGUECHEEK. Where shall I find you?
AGUECHEEK. Here's the challenge; read it. I warrant there's vinegar
AGUECHEEK. Ay, is't, I warrant him; do but read.
AGUECHEEK. Nay, let me alone for swearing.                Exit
AGUECHEEK. Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him.

AGAMEMNON. No question.
AGAMEMNON. No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as wise,

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I am not in a sportive humour now;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Now, as I am a Christian, answer me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy mistress' marks! What mistress, slave, hast thou?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Upon my life, by some device or other

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sound I pray you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Name them.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. You would all this time have prov'd there
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. But your reason was not substantial, why

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How can she thus, then, call us by our names,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think thou art in mind, and so am I.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou hast thine own form.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Well, I'll break in; go borrow me a crow.

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You have prevail'd. I will depart in quiet,
ANGELO. I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do so; this jest shall cost me some expense.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Sweet mistress-what your name is else, I know not,

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is she?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How dost thou mean a fat marriage?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What complexion is she of?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. That's a fault that water will mend.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What's her name?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Then she bears some breadth?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In what part of her body stands Ireland?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Scotland?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where France?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where England?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Spain?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where America, the Indies?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go hie thee presently post to the road;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's none but witches do inhabit here,
ANGELO. Master Antipholus!
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Ay, that's my name.
ANGELO. I know it well, sir. Lo, here is the chain.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is your will that I shall do with this?
ANGELO. What please yourself, sir; I have made it for you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.
ANGELO. Not once nor twice, but twenty times you have.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
ANGELO. You are a merry man, sir; fare you well.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What I should think of this cannot tell:
ANGELO. Even just the sum that I do owe to you
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. A man is well holp up that trusts to you!
ANGELO. Saving your merry humour, here's the note
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I am not furnish'd with the present money;
ANGELO. Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.
ANGELO. Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
ANGELO. Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
ANGELO. You hear how he importunes me-the chain!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money.
ANGELO. Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fie, now you run this humour out of breath!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I answer you! What should I answer you?
ANGELO. The money that you owe me for the chain.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I owe you none till I receive the chain.
ANGELO. You know I gave it you half an hour since.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You gave me none; you wrong me much to say so.
ANGELO. You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.
ANGELO. This touches me in reputation.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Consent to pay thee that I never had!
ANGELO. Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
ANGELO. Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. How now! a madman? Why, thou peevish sheep,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. THOU drunken slave! I sent the for a rope;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I Will debate this matter at more leisure,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I understand thee not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, thou mean'st an officer?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The fellow is distract, and so am I;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. It is the devil.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, Dromio?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avoid then, fiend! What tell'st thou me of supping?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fear me not, man; I will not break away.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. But where's the money?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Five hundred ducats, villain, for rope?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou whoreson, senseless villain!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou art sensible in nothing but
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wilt thou still talk?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You minion, you, are these your customers?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Din'd at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not she herself revile me there?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not I in rage depart from thence?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Went'st not thou to her for purse of ducats?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O most unhappy strumpet!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Out on thee, villian! Wherefore
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I see these witches are afraid of swords.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I will not stay to-night for all the town;
ANGELO. I am sorry, sir, that I have hind'red you;
ANGELO. Of very reverend reputation, sir,
ANGELO. 'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think I had; I never did deny it.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art a villain to impeach me thus;
ANGELO. I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
ANGELO. Upon what cause?
ANGELO. See where they come; we will behold his death.
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, most gracious Duke; O, grant me justice!
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, sweet Prince, against that woman there!
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. This day, great Duke, she shut the doors upon me,
ANGELO. O peflur'd woman! They are both forsworn.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. My liege, I am advised what I say;
ANGELO. My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
ANGELO. He had, my lord, and when he ran in here,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never came within these abbey walls,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. 'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw you in my life till now.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Neither.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw my father in my life.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. The Duke and all that know me in
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Aegeon, art thou not? or else his
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I, gentle mistress.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; I say nay to that.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. And so do I, yet did she call me so;
ANGELO. That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think it be, sir; I deny it not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
ANGELO. I think I did, sir; I deny it not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. This purse of ducats I receiv'd from you,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. These ducats pawn I for my father here.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There, take it; and much thanks for my
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio.

ANTONY. Caesar?
ANTONY. Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
ANTONY. So to most noble Caesar.
ANTONY. O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?
ANTONY. I doubt not of your wisdom.  
ANTONY. Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
ANTONY. Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed
ANTONY. That's all I seek;
ANTONY. Be it so,
ANTONY. O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
ANTONY. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
ANTONY. Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.
ANTONY. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.
ANTONY. For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
ANTONY. You gentle Romans-
ANTONY. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!
ANTONY. But yesterday the word of Caesar might

ANTONY. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?
ANTONY. You will compel me then to read the will?
ANTONY. Nay, press not so upon me, stand far off.  
ANTONY. If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
ANTONY. Stay, countrymen.
ANTONY. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
ANTONY. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
ANTONY. Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.
ANTONY. Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
ANTONY. Hear me with patience.
ANTONY. Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
ANTONY. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
ANTONY. Where is he?
ANTONY. And thither will I straight to visit him.
ANTONY. Be like they had some notice of the people,
ANTONY. These many then shall die, their names are prick'd.
ANTONY. He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
ANTONY. This is a slight unmeritable man,
ANTONY. Octavius, I have seen more days than you,
ANTONY. So is my horse, Octavius, and for that
ANTONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
ANTONY. Octavius, lead your battle softly on,

ANTONY. No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
ANTONY. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
ANTONY. Not stingless too.
ANTONY. Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers
ANTONY. Old Cassius still!

ANTIGONUS. And I wish, my liege,
ANTIGONUS.  [Aside]  To laughter, as I take it,  
ANTIGONUS. That's enough.  
ANTIGONUS. I told her so, my lord,
ANTIGONUS. La you now, you hear!
ANTIGONUS. I am none, by this good light.
ANTIGONUS. Hang all the husbands  
ANTIGONUS. I did not, sir.
ANTIGONUS. Anything, my lord,  
ANTIGONUS. I will, my lord.
ANTIGONUS. I swear to do this, though a present death
ANTIGONUS. Thou art perfect then our ship hath touch'd upon
ANTIGONUS. Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;
ANTIGONUS. Go thou away;
ANTIGONUS. Come, poor babe.
ANTONY. There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
ANTONY. Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.
ANTONY. Grates me the sum.
ANTONY. How, my love?
ANTONY. Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
ANTONY. But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
ANTONY. Fie, wrangling queen!
ANTONY. Against my brother Lucius?
ANTONY. Well, what worst?
ANTONY. When it concerns the fool or coward. On!
ANTONY. Antony, thou wouldst say.
ANTONY. Speak to me home; mince not the general tongue;
ANTONY. From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!
ANTONY. Let him appear.
ANTONY. Where died she?
ANTONY. Forbear me.                             Exit MESSENGER
ANTONY. I must with haste from hence.
ANTONY. I must be gone.
ANTONY. She is cunning past man's thought.
ANTONY. Would I had never seen her!
ANTONY. Fulvia is dead.
ANTONY. Fulvia is dead.
ANTONY. Dead.
ANTONY. The business she hath broached in the state
ANTONY. No more light answers. Let our officers
ANTONY. I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose-
ANTONY. Now, my dearest queen-
ANTONY. What's the matter?
ANTONY. The gods best know-
ANTONY. Cleopatra-
ANTONY. Most sweet queen-
ANTONY. How now, lady!
ANTONY. Hear me, queen:
ANTONY. She's dead, my Queen.
ANTONY. Quarrel no more, but be prepar'd to know
ANTONY. My precious queen, forbear,
ANTONY. You'll heat my blood; no more.
ANTONY. Now, by my sword-
ANTONY. I'll leave you, lady.
ANTONY. But that your royalty
ANTONY. Let us go. Come.
ANTONY. If we compose well here, to Parthia.
ANTONY. 'Tis spoken well.
ANTONY. Thank you.
ANTONY. Sit, sir.
ANTONY. I learn you take things ill which are not so,
ANTONY. My being in Egypt, Caesar,
ANTONY. How intend you- practis'd?
ANTONY. You do mistake your business; my brother never
ANTONY. Not so, not so;
ANTONY. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,
ANTONY. Sir,
ANTONY. No;
ANTONY. Neglected, rather;  
ANTONY. Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.  
ANTONY. You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
ANTONY. I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear
ANTONY. Will Caesar speak?
ANTONY. What power is in Agrippa,
ANTONY. May I never
ANTONY. I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;
ANTONY. Where lies he?
ANTONY. What is his strength by land?
ANTONY. So is the fame.
ANTONY. Let us, Lepidus,
ANTONY. The world and my great office will sometimes
ANTONY. Good night, sir. My Octavia,
ANTONY. Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?
ANTONY. If you can- your reason.  
ANTONY. Say to me,
ANTONY. Speak this no more.
ANTONY. Get thee gone.  
ANTONY. Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
ANTONY. Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
ANTONY. I have heard it, Pompey,
ANTONY. The beds i' th' East are soft; and thanks to you,
ANTONY. That will I, Pompey.
ANTONY. You have heard much.
ANTONY. And fair words to them.
ANTONY. [To CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o' th'
ANTONY. Ay, Lepidus.
ANTONY. They are so.
ANTONY. It is shap'd, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it
ANTONY. Of it own colour too.
ANTONY. 'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.
ANTONY. With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very
ANTONY. These quicksands, Lepidus,
ANTONY. Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.
ANTONY. It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho!
ANTONY. Be a child o' th' time.
ANTONY. Come, let's all take hands,
ANTONY. And shall, sir. Give's your hand.
ANTONY. No further, sir.
ANTONY. Make me not offended
ANTONY. You shall not find,
ANTONY. The April's in her eyes. It is love's spring,
ANTONY. Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can  
ANTONY. Come, sir, come;  
ANTONY. Farewell!                       Trumpets sound. Exeunt
ANTONY. Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that-
ANTONY. Gentle Octavia,
ANTONY. When it appears to you where this begins,
ANTONY'S camp near Actium
ANTONY. Is it not strange, Canidius,
ANTONY. A good rebuke,
ANTONY. For that he dares us to't.
ANTONY. By sea, by sea.
ANTONY. I'll fight at sea.
ANTONY. Our overplus of shipping will we burn,
ANTONY. Can he be there in person? 'Tis impossible-
ANTONY. Well, well- away.
ANTONY. Set we our squadrons on yon side o' th' hill,
ANTONY. Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;
ANTONY. I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards
ANTONY. No, no, no, no, no.
ANTONY. O, fie, fie, fie!
ANTONY. Yes, my lord, yes. He at Philippi kept
ANTONY. I have offended reputation-
ANTONY. O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See
ANTONY. Egypt, thou knew'st too well
ANTONY. Now I must
ANTONY. Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates
ANTONY. Is that his answer?
ANTONY. The Queen shall then have courtesy, so she
ANTONY. Let her know't.
ANTONY. To him again. Tell him he wears the rose
ANTONY. Favours, by Jove that thunders!  
ANTONY. Approach there.- Ah, you kite!- Now, gods and devils!
ANTONY. Moon and stars!
ANTONY. Tug him away. Being whipt,
ANTONY. You have been a boggler ever.
ANTONY. I found you as a morsel cold upon
ANTONY. To let a fellow that will take rewards,
ANTONY. Cried he? and begg'd 'a pardon?
ANTONY. If that thy father live, let him repent
ANTONY. Alack, our terrene moon
ANTONY. To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes
ANTONY. Cold-hearted toward me?
ANTONY. I am satisfied.
ANTONY. I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breath'd,
ANTONY. We will yet do well.
ANTONY. Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
ANTONY. He will not fight with me, Domitius?
ANTONY. Why should he not?
ANTONY. To-morrow, soldier,
ANTONY. Well said; come on.
ANTONY. And thou art honest too.
ANTONY. Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night.
ANTONY. Tend me to-night;
ANTONY. Ho, ho, ho!
ANTONY. Eros! mine armour, Eros!
ANTONY. No, my chuck. Eros! Come, mine armour, Eros!
ANTONY. Ah, let be, let be! Thou art
ANTONY. Well, well;
ANTONY. Rarely, rarely!
ANTONY. 'Tis well blown, lads.
ANTONY. Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
ANTONY. Who's gone this morning?
ANTONY. What say'st thou?
ANTONY. Is he gone?
ANTONY. Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;
ANTONY. Thou bleed'st apace.
ANTONY. They do retire.
ANTONY. I will reward thee
ANTONY. We have beat him to his camp. Run one before
ANTONY. Mine nightingale,
ANTONY. He has deserv'd it, were it carbuncled
ANTONY. Their preparation is to-day by sea;
ANTONY. I would they'd fight i' th' fire or i' th' air;
ANTONY. Yet they are not join'd. Where yond pine does stand
ANTONY. All is lost!
ANTONY. Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving
ANTONY. Eros, thou yet behold'st me?
ANTONY. Sometime we see a cloud that's dragonish;
ANTONY. That which is now a horse, even with a thought
ANTONY. My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
ANTONY. Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!
ANTONY. Dead then?
ANTONY. Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
ANTONY. Since Cleopatra died,
ANTONY. Eros,
ANTONY. Come, then; for with a wound I must be cur'd.  
ANTONY. When I did make thee free, swor'st thou not then
ANTONY. Lo thee!                            [Turning from him]
ANTONY. Then let it do at once
ANTONY. 'Tis said, man; and farewell.
ANTONY. Now, Eros.
ANTONY. Thrice nobler than myself!
ANTONY. I have done my work ill, friends. O, make an end
ANTONY. Let him that loves me, strike me dead.
ANTONY. Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword and give me
ANTONY. When did she send thee?  
ANTONY. Where is she?
ANTONY. Too late, good Diomed. Call my guard, I prithee.
ANTONY. Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;
ANTONY. Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate
ANTONY. Peace!
ANTONY. I am dying, Egypt, dying; only
ANTONY. O, quick, or I am gone.
ANTONY. I am dying, Egypt, dying.
ANTONY. One word, sweet queen:
ANTONY. Gentle, hear me:
ANTONY. The miserable change now at my end
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS twin brothers and sons to
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Aegion and Aemelia
ANGELO, a goldsmith
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Farewell till then. I will go lose myself,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He that commends me to mine own content
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Stop in your wind, sir; tell me this, I pray:
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I am not in a sportive humour now;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Now, as I am a Christian, answer me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy mistress' marks! What mistress, slave, hast thou?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Upon my life, by some device or other
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Even now, even here, not half an hour since.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Because that I familiarly sometimes
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Dost thou not know?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Shall I tell you why?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, first for flouting me; and then wherefore,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thank me, sir! for what?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I'll make you amends next, to
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In good time, sir, what's that?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Your reason?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, learn to jest in good time;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By what rule, sir?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Let's hear it.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. May he not do it by fine and recovery?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why is Time such a niggard of
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, but there's many a man
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, thou didst conclude hairy
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For what reason?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sound I pray you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Name them.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. You would all this time have prov'd there
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. But your reason was not substantial, why
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I knew 't'would be a bald conclusion. But,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By Dromio?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How can she thus, then, call us by our names,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think thou art in mind, and so am I.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou hast thine own form.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I think thou art an ass.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Y'are sad, Signior Balthazar; pray God our cheer
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And welcome more common; for that's nothing
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Who talks within there? Ho, open the door!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wherefore? For my dinner;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What art thou that keep'st me out
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do you hear, you minion? You'll let us in, I hope?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou baggage, let me in.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You'll cry for this, minion, if beat the door down.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Are you there, wife? You might
ANGELO. Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome; we would fain have either.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go fetch me something; I'll break ope the gate.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Well, I'll break in; go borrow me a crow.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You have prevail'd. I will depart in quiet,
ANGELO. I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do so; this jest shall cost me some expense.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Sweet mistress-what your name is else, I know not,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy sister's sister.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, how now, Dromio! Where run'st thou
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art Dromio, thou art my
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What woman's man, and how besides thyself?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What claim lays she to thee?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is she?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How dost thou mean a fat marriage?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What complexion is she of?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. That's a fault that water will mend.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What's her name?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Then she bears some breadth?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In what part of her body stands Ireland?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Scotland?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where France?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where England?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Spain?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where America, the Indies?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go hie thee presently post to the road;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's none but witches do inhabit here,
ANGELO. Master Antipholus!
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Ay, that's my name.
ANGELO. I know it well, sir. Lo, here is the chain.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is your will that I shall do with this?
ANGELO. What please yourself, sir; I have made it for you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.
ANGELO. Not once nor twice, but twenty times you have.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
ANGELO. You are a merry man, sir; fare you well.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What I should think of this cannot tell:
ANGELO. Even just the sum that I do owe to you
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. A man is well holp up that trusts to you!
ANGELO. Saving your merry humour, here's the note
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I am not furnish'd with the present money;
ANGELO. Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.
ANGELO. Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
ANGELO. Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
ANGELO. You hear how he importunes me-the chain!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money.
ANGELO. Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fie, now you run this humour out of breath!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I answer you! What should I answer you?
ANGELO. The money that you owe me for the chain.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I owe you none till I receive the chain.
ANGELO. You know I gave it you half an hour since.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You gave me none; you wrong me much to say so.
ANGELO. You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.
ANGELO. This touches me in reputation.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Consent to pay thee that I never had!
ANGELO. Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
ANGELO. Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. How now! a madman? Why, thou peevish sheep,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. THOU drunken slave! I sent the for a rope;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I Will debate this matter at more leisure,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I understand thee not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, thou mean'st an officer?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The fellow is distract, and so am I;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. It is the devil.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, Dromio?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avoid then, fiend! What tell'st thou me of supping?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fear me not, man; I will not break away.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. But where's the money?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Five hundred ducats, villain, for rope?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou whoreson, senseless villain!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou art sensible in nothing but
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wilt thou still talk?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You minion, you, are these your customers?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Din'd at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not she herself revile me there?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not I in rage depart from thence?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Went'st not thou to her for purse of ducats?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O most unhappy strumpet!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Out on thee, villian! Wherefore
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I see these witches are afraid of swords.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I will not stay to-night for all the town;
ANGELO. I am sorry, sir, that I have hind'red you;
ANGELO. Of very reverend reputation, sir,
ANGELO. 'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think I had; I never did deny it.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art a villain to impeach me thus;
ANGELO. I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
ANGELO. Upon what cause?
ANGELO. See where they come; we will behold his death.
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, most gracious Duke; O, grant me justice!
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, sweet Prince, against that woman there!
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. This day, great Duke, she shut the doors upon me,
ANGELO. O peflur'd woman! They are both forsworn.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. My liege, I am advised what I say;
ANGELO. My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
ANGELO. He had, my lord, and when he ran in here,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never came within these abbey walls,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. 'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw you in my life till now.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Neither.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw my father in my life.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. The Duke and all that know me in
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Aegeon, art thou not? or else his
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I, gentle mistress.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; I say nay to that.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. And so do I, yet did she call me so;
ANGELO. That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think it be, sir; I deny it not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
ANGELO. I think I did, sir; I deny it not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. This purse of ducats I receiv'd from you,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. These ducats pawn I for my father here.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There, take it; and much thanks for my
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio.
AN OLD SHEPHERD, father to Joan la Pucelle
ANNE BULLEN, her Maid of Honour, afterwards Queen
AN OLD LADY, friend to Anne Bullen
ANNE. Was he mad, sir?
ANNE. You are a merry gamester,
ANNE. You cannot show me.
ANNE. Not for that neither. Here's the pang that pinches:
ANNE. O, God's will! much better
ANNE. So much the more
ANNE. By my troth and maidenhead,
ANNE. Nay, good troth.
ANNE. No, not for all the riches under heaven.
ANNE. No, in truth.
ANNE. How you do talk!
ANNE. My good lord,
ANNE. Now, I pray God, amen!
ANNE. I do not know
ANNE. My honour'd lord!                       Exit LORD CHAMBERLAIN
ANNE. This is strange to me.
ANNE. Come, you are pleasant.
ANNE. Good lady,
ANTONY. Caesar, my lord?
ANTONY. I shall remember.
ANTONY. Caesar?
ANTONY. Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
ANTONY. So to most noble Caesar.
ANTONY. O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?
ANTONY. I doubt not of your wisdom.  
ANTONY. Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
ANTONY. Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed
ANTONY. That's all I seek;
ANTONY. Be it so,
ANTONY. O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
ANTONY. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
ANTONY. Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.
ANTONY. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.
ANTONY. For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
ANTONY. You gentle Romans-
ANTONY. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!
ANTONY. But yesterday the word of Caesar might
ANTONY. Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
ANTONY. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?
ANTONY. You will compel me then to read the will?
ANTONY. Nay, press not so upon me, stand far off.  
ANTONY. If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
ANTONY. Stay, countrymen.
ANTONY. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
ANTONY. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
ANTONY. Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.
ANTONY. Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
ANTONY. Hear me with patience.
ANTONY. Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
ANTONY. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
ANTONY. Where is he?
ANTONY. And thither will I straight to visit him.
ANTONY. Be like they had some notice of the people,
ANTONY. These many then shall die, their names are prick'd.

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I'll make you amends next, to
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In good time, sir, what's that?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Your reason?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, learn to jest in good time;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By what rule, sir?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Let's hear it.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. May he not do it by fine and recovery?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why is Time such a niggard of
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, but there's many a man
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, thou didst conclude hairy
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For what reason?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sound I pray you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Name them.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. You would all this time have prov'd there
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. But your reason was not substantial, why
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I knew 't'would be a bald conclusion. But,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By Dromio?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How can she thus, then, call us by our names,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think thou art in mind, and so am I.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou hast thine own form.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I think thou art an ass.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Y'are sad, Signior Balthazar; pray God our cheer
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And welcome more common; for that's nothing
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Who talks within there? Ho, open the door!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wherefore? For my dinner;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What art thou that keep'st me out
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do you hear, you minion? You'll let us in, I hope?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou baggage, let me in.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You'll cry for this, minion, if beat the door down.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Are you there, wife? You might
ANGELO. Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome; we would fain have either.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go fetch me something; I'll break ope the gate.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Well, I'll break in; go borrow me a crow.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You have prevail'd. I will depart in quiet,
ANGELO. I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do so; this jest shall cost me some expense.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Sweet mistress-what your name is else, I know not,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy sister's sister.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, how now, Dromio! Where run'st thou
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art Dromio, thou art my
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What woman's man, and how besides thyself?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What claim lays she to thee?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is she?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How dost thou mean a fat marriage?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What complexion is she of?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. That's a fault that water will mend.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What's her name?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Then she bears some breadth?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In what part of her body stands Ireland?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Scotland?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where France?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where England?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Spain?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where America, the Indies?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go hie thee presently post to the road;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's none but witches do inhabit here,
ANGELO. Master Antipholus!
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Ay, that's my name.
ANGELO. I know it well, sir. Lo, here is the chain.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is your will that I shall do with this?
ANGELO. What please yourself, sir; I have made it for you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.
ANGELO. Not once nor twice, but twenty times you have.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
ANGELO. You are a merry man, sir; fare you well.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What I should think of this cannot tell:
ANGELO. Even just the sum that I do owe to you
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. A man is well holp up that trusts to you!
ANGELO. Saving your merry humour, here's the note
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I am not furnish'd with the present money;
ANGELO. Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.
ANGELO. Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
ANGELO. Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
ANGELO. You hear how he importunes me-the chain!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money.
ANGELO. Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fie, now you run this humour out of breath!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I answer you! What should I answer you?
ANGELO. The money that you owe me for the chain.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I owe you none till I receive the chain.
ANGELO. You know I gave it you half an hour since.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You gave me none; you wrong me much to say so.
ANGELO. You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.
ANGELO. This touches me in reputation.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Consent to pay thee that I never had!
ANGELO. Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
ANGELO. Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. How now! a madman? Why, thou peevish sheep,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. THOU drunken slave! I sent the for a rope;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I Will debate this matter at more leisure,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I understand thee not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, thou mean'st an officer?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The fellow is distract, and so am I;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. It is the devil.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, Dromio?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avoid then, fiend! What tell'st thou me of supping?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fear me not, man; I will not break away.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. But where's the money?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Five hundred ducats, villain, for rope?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou whoreson, senseless villain!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou art sensible in nothing but
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wilt thou still talk?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You minion, you, are these your customers?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Din'd at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not she herself revile me there?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not I in rage depart from thence?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Went'st not thou to her for purse of ducats?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O most unhappy strumpet!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Out on thee, villian! Wherefore
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I see these witches are afraid of swords.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I will not stay to-night for all the town;
ANGELO. I am sorry, sir, that I have hind'red you;
ANGELO. Of very reverend reputation, sir,
ANGELO. 'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think I had; I never did deny it.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art a villain to impeach me thus;
ANGELO. I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
ANGELO. Upon what cause?
ANGELO. See where they come; we will behold his death.
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, most gracious Duke; O, grant me justice!
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, sweet Prince, against that woman there!
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. This day, great Duke, she shut the doors upon me,
ANGELO. O peflur'd woman! They are both forsworn.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. My liege, I am advised what I say;
ANGELO. My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
ANGELO. He had, my lord, and when he ran in here,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never came within these abbey walls,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. 'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw you in my life till now.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Neither.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw my father in my life.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. The Duke and all that know me in
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Aegeon, art thou not? or else his
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I, gentle mistress.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; I say nay to that.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. And so do I, yet did she call me so;
ANGELO. That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think it be, sir; I deny it not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
ANGELO. I think I did, sir; I deny it not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. This purse of ducats I receiv'd from you,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. These ducats pawn I for my father here.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There, take it; and much thanks for my
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio.

ANNE BULLEN, her Maid of Honour, afterwards Queen
AN OLD LADY, friend to Anne Bullen
ANNE. Was he mad, sir?
ANNE. You are a merry gamester,
ANNE. You cannot show me.
ANNE. Not for that neither. Here's the pang that pinches:
ANNE. O, God's will! much better
ANNE. So much the more
ANNE. By my troth and maidenhead,
ANNE. Nay, good troth.
ANNE. No, not for all the riches under heaven.
ANNE. No, in truth.
ANNE. How you do talk!
ANNE. My good lord,

ANNE. I do not know
ANNE. My honour'd lord!                       Exit LORD CHAMBERLAIN
ANNE. This is strange to me.
ANNE. Come, you are pleasant.
ANNE. Good lady,
ANTONY. Caesar, my lord?
ANTONY. I shall remember.
ANTONY. Caesar?
ANTONY. Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
ANTONY. So to most noble Caesar.
ANTONY. O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?
ANTONY. I doubt not of your wisdom.  
ANTONY. Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
ANTONY. Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed
ANTONY. That's all I seek;
ANTONY. Be it so,
ANTONY. O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
ANTONY. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
ANTONY. Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.
ANTONY. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.
ANTONY. For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
ANTONY. You gentle Romans-
ANTONY. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!
ANTONY. But yesterday the word of Caesar might
ANTONY. Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
ANTONY. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?
ANTONY. You will compel me then to read the will?
ANTONY. Nay, press not so upon me, stand far off.  
ANTONY. If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
ANTONY. Stay, countrymen.
ANTONY. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
ANTONY. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
ANTONY. Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.
ANTONY. Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
ANTONY. Hear me with patience.
ANTONY. Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
ANTONY. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
ANTONY. Where is he?
ANTONY. And thither will I straight to visit him.
ANTONY. Be like they had some notice of the people,
ANTONY. These many then shall die, their names are prick'd.
ANTONY. He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
ANTONY. This is a slight unmeritable man,
ANTONY. Octavius, I have seen more days than you,
ANTONY. So is my horse, Octavius, and for that
ANTONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
ANTONY. Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
ANTONY. Why do you cross me in this exigent?
ANTONY. No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
ANTONY. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
ANTONY. Not stingless too.
ANTONY. Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers
ANTONY. Old Cassius still!
ANTONY. Where is he?
ANTONY. This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,
ANTONY. This was the noblest Roman of them all.

ANGELO, the Deputy
ANGELO. Always obedient to your Grace's will,
ANGELO. Now, good my lord,
ANGELO. Yet give leave, my lord,
ANGELO. The heavens give safety to your purposes!
ANGELO. 'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
ANGELO. We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
ANGELO. 'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
ANGELO. Where is the Provost?
ANGELO. See that Claudio  
ANGELO. How now, sir! What's your name, and what's the matter?
ANGELO. Benefactors! Well- what benefactors are they? Are they not
ANGELO. Go to; what quality are they of? Elbow is your name? Why
ANGELO. What are you, sir?
ANGELO. This will last out a night in Russia,
ANGELO. Now, what's the matter, Provost?
ANGELO. Did not I tell thee yea? Hadst thou not order?
ANGELO. Go to; let that be mine.
ANGELO. Dispose of her
ANGELO. Hath he a sister?
ANGELO. Well, let her be admitted.                Exit SERVANT
ANGELO. Stay a little while. [To ISABELLA] Y'are welcome; what's
ANGELO. Well; what's your suit?
ANGELO. Well; the matter?
ANGELO. Condemn the fault and not the actor of it!
ANGELO. Maiden, no remedy.
ANGELO. I will not do't.
ANGELO. Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.  
ANGELO. He's sentenc'd; 'tis too late.
ANGELO. Pray you be gone.
ANGELO. Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
ANGELO. Be you content, fair maid.
ANGELO. The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept.
ANGELO. I show it most of all when I show justice;
ANGELO. Why do you put these sayings upon me?
ANGELO. [Aside] She speaks, and 'tis
ANGELO. I will bethink me. Come again to-morrow.
ANGELO. How, bribe me?
ANGELO. Well; come to me to-morrow.

ANGELO. Yea.
ANGELO. Ha! Fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
ANGELO. Say you so? Then I shall pose you quickly.
ANGELO. I talk not of your soul; our compell'd sins
ANGELO. Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
ANGELO. Pleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul,
ANGELO. Nay, but hear me;
ANGELO. Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
ANGELO. And his offence is so, as it appears,  
ANGELO. Admit no other way to save his life,
ANGELO. Then must your brother die.  
ANGELO. Were not you, then, as cruel as the sentence
ANGELO. You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
ANGELO. We are all frail.
ANGELO. Nay, women are frail too.
ANGELO. I think it well;
ANGELO. Plainly conceive, I love you.
ANGELO. He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
ANGELO. Believe me, on mine honour,
ANGELO. Who will believe thee, Isabel?
ANGELO'S house
ANGELO. In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions show much
ANGELO. And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his

ANGELO, ESCALUS. Happy return be to your royal Grace!
ANGELO. You make my bonds still greater.
ANGELO. My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm;
ANGELO. And she will speak most bitterly and strange.
ANGELO. Charges she moe than me?
ANGELO. This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.
ANGELO. My lord, I must confess I know this woman;
ANGELO. I did but smile till now.
ANGELO. What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
ANGELO. Hark how the villain would close now, after his treasonable

ANTONIO, a merchant of Venice
ANTONIO. In sooth, I know not why I am so sad.
ANTONIO. Believe me, no; I thank my fortune for it,
ANTONIO. Fie, fie!
ANTONIO. Your worth is very dear in my regard.
ANTONIO. I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano-
ANTONIO. Fare you well; I'll grow a talker for this gear.  
ANTONIO. Is that anything now?
ANTONIO. Well; tell me now what lady is the same
ANTONIO. I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
ANTONIO. You know me well, and herein spend but time
ANTONIO. Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
ANTONIO. Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow
ANTONIO. And for three months.
ANTONIO. I do never use it.
ANTONIO. And what of him? Did he take interest?
ANTONIO. This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv'd for;
ANTONIO.  [Aside]  Mark you this, Bassanio,
ANTONIO. Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
ANTONIO. I am as like to call thee so again,
ANTONIO. Content, in faith; I'll seal to such a bond,
ANTONIO. Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it;
ANTONIO. Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
ANTONIO. Hie thee, gentle Jew.                    Exit SHYLOCK
ANTONIO. Come on; in this there can be no dismay;
ANTONIO. Who's there?  
ANTONIO. Fie, fie, Gratiano, where are all the rest?
ANTONIO. Hear me yet, good Shylock.
ANTONIO. I pray thee hear me speak.
ANTONIO. Let him alone;
ANTONIO. The Duke cannot deny the course of law;
ANTONIO. Ready, so please your Grace.
ANTONIO. I have heard
ANTONIO. I pray you, think you question with the Jew.
ANTONIO. I am a tainted wether of the flock,
ANTONIO. Ay, so he says.
ANTONIO. I do.
ANTONIO. Most heartily I do beseech the court  
ANTONIO. But little: I am arm'd and well prepar'd.
ANTONIO. So please my lord the Duke and all the court
ANTONIO. And stand indebted, over and above,
ANTONIO. My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring.
ANTONIO. No more than I am well acquitted of.
ANTONIO. I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels.
ANTONIO. I once did lend my body for his wealth,
ANTONIO. Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.
ANTONIO. I am dumb.
ANTONIO. Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;

ANNE. Alas, how then?
ANNE.. May be he tells you true.
ANNE. Gentle Master Fenton,

ANNE. Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.  
ANNE. Now, Master Slender-
ANNE. What is your will?
ANNE. I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?
ANNE. Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.
ANNE. Alas, I had rather be set quick i' th' earth.
ANNE. Pardon, good father. Good my mother, pardon.
ANOTHER LORD. I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;
ANNE. Set down, set down your honourable load-
ANNE. What black magician conjures up this fiend
ANNE. What, do you tremble? Are you all afraid?
ANNE. Foul devil, for God's sake, hence and trouble us not;
ANNE. Villain, thou knowest nor law of God nor man:
ANNE. O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
ANNE. Vouchsafe, diffus'd infection of a man,
ANNE. Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
ANNE. And by despairing shalt thou stand excused
ANNE. Then say they were not slain.
ANNE. Why, then he is alive.
ANNE. In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
ANNE. Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind,
ANNE. Dost grant me, hedgehog? Then, God grant me to
ANNE. He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
ANNE. And thou unfit for any place but hell.
ANNE. Some dungeon.
ANNE. Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
ANNE. I hope so.
ANNE. Thou wast the cause and most accurs'd effect.
ANNE. If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
ANNE. Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
ANNE. I would I were, to be reveng'd on thee.
ANNE. It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
ANNE. His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
ANNE. Name him.
ANNE. Why, that was he.
ANNE. Where is he?
ANNE. Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!
ANNE. Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
ANNE. Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead!
ANNE. Arise, dissembler; though I wish thy death,
ANNE. I have already.
ANNE. I would I knew thy heart.
ANNE. I fear me both are false.

ANNE. That shalt thou know hereafter.
ANNE. All men, I hope, live so.
ANNE. To take is not to give.               [Puts on the ring]
ANNE. What is it?
ANNE. With all my heart; and much it joys me too
ANNE. 'Tis more than you deserve;
ANNE, DUCHESS of GLOUCESTER, leading LADY MARGARET PLANTAGENET,
ANNE. God give your Graces both
ANNE. No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,
ANNE. Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother.
ANNE. Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!
ANNE. And I with all unwillingness will go.
ANNE. No, why? When he that is my husband now
ANNE. No more than with my soul I mourn for yours.
ANNE. Adieu, poor soul, that tak'st thy leave of it!
ANTONIO, his brother, the usurping Duke of Milan
ANTONIO. Where is the master, boson?
ANTONIO. Hang, cur; hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker;  
ANTONIO. We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards.
ANTONIO. Let's all sink wi' th' King.
ANTONIO. The visitor will not give him o'er so.
ANTONIO. Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
ANTONIO. Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first
ANTONIO. The cock'rel.
ANTONIO. A laughter.
ANTONIO. Ha, ha, ha!
ANTONIO. He could not miss't.
ANTONIO. Temperance was a delicate wench.
ANTONIO. Or, as 'twere perfum'd by a fen.
ANTONIO. True; save means to live.
ANTONIO. The ground indeed is tawny.
ANTONIO. He misses not much.
ANTONIO. If but one of his pockets could speak, would it
ANTONIO. Widow! a pox o' that! How came that 'widow'
ANTONIO. His word is more than the miraculous harp.
ANTONIO. What impossible matter will he make easy next?

ANTONY. What say'st thou?
ANTONY. Is he gone?
ANTONY. Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;
ANTONY. Thou bleed'st apace.
ANTONY. They do retire.
ANTONY. I will reward thee
ANTONY. We have beat him to his camp. Run one before

ANTONY. Dead then?
ANTONY. Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
ANTONY. Since Cleopatra died,
ANTONY. Eros,
ANTONY. Come, then; for with a wound I must be cur'd.  
ANTONY. When I did make thee free, swor'st thou not then
ANTONY. Lo thee!                            [Turning from him]
ANTONY. Then let it do at once
ANTONY. 'Tis said, man; and farewell.
ANTONY. Now, Eros.
ANTONY. Thrice nobler than myself!
ANTONY. I have done my work ill, friends. O, make an end
ANTONY. Let him that loves me, strike me dead.

ANTONY. When did she send thee?  
ANTONY. Where is she?
ANTONY. Too late, good Diomed. Call my guard, I prithee.
ANTONY. Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;
ANTONY. Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate
ANTONY. Peace!
ANTONY. I am dying, Egypt, dying; only

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Farewell till then. I will go lose myself,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He that commends me to mine own content
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Stop in your wind, sir; tell me this, I pray:
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I am not in a sportive humour now;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Now, as I am a Christian, answer me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy mistress' marks! What mistress, slave, hast thou?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Upon my life, by some device or other
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Even now, even here, not half an hour since.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Because that I familiarly sometimes
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Dost thou not know?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Shall I tell you why?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, first for flouting me; and then wherefore,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thank me, sir! for what?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I'll make you amends next, to
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In good time, sir, what's that?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Your reason?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, learn to jest in good time;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By what rule, sir?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Let's hear it.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. May he not do it by fine and recovery?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why is Time such a niggard of

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, thou didst conclude hairy
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For what reason?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sound I pray you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Name them.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. You would all this time have prov'd there
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. But your reason was not substantial, why
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I knew 't'would be a bald conclusion. But,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By Dromio?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How can she thus, then, call us by our names,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think thou art in mind, and so am I.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou hast thine own form.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I think thou art an ass.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Y'are sad, Signior Balthazar; pray God our cheer
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And welcome more common; for that's nothing
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Who talks within there? Ho, open the door!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wherefore? For my dinner;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What art thou that keep'st me out
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do you hear, you minion? You'll let us in, I hope?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou baggage, let me in.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You'll cry for this, minion, if beat the door down.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Are you there, wife? You might
ANGELO. Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome; we would fain have either.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go fetch me something; I'll break ope the gate.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Well, I'll break in; go borrow me a crow.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You have prevail'd. I will depart in quiet,
ANGELO. I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do so; this jest shall cost me some expense.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Sweet mistress-what your name is else, I know not,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy sister's sister.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, how now, Dromio! Where run'st thou
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art Dromio, thou art my
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What woman's man, and how besides thyself?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What claim lays she to thee?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is she?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How dost thou mean a fat marriage?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What complexion is she of?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. That's a fault that water will mend.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What's her name?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Then she bears some breadth?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In what part of her body stands Ireland?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Scotland?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where France?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where England?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Spain?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where America, the Indies?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's none but witches do inhabit here,
ANGELO. Master Antipholus!
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Ay, that's my name.
ANGELO. I know it well, sir. Lo, here is the chain.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is your will that I shall do with this?
ANGELO. What please yourself, sir; I have made it for you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.
ANGELO. Not once nor twice, but twenty times you have.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
ANGELO. You are a merry man, sir; fare you well.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What I should think of this cannot tell:
ANGELO. Even just the sum that I do owe to you
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. A man is well holp up that trusts to you!
ANGELO. Saving your merry humour, here's the note
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I am not furnish'd with the present money;
ANGELO. Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.
ANGELO. Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
ANGELO. Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
ANGELO. You hear how he importunes me-the chain!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money.
ANGELO. Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fie, now you run this humour out of breath!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I answer you! What should I answer you?
ANGELO. The money that you owe me for the chain.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I owe you none till I receive the chain.
ANGELO. You know I gave it you half an hour since.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You gave me none; you wrong me much to say so.
ANGELO. You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.
ANGELO. This touches me in reputation.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Consent to pay thee that I never had!
ANGELO. Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
ANGELO. Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. How now! a madman? Why, thou peevish sheep,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. THOU drunken slave! I sent the for a rope;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I Will debate this matter at more leisure,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I understand thee not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, thou mean'st an officer?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The fellow is distract, and so am I;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. It is the devil.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, Dromio?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avoid then, fiend! What tell'st thou me of supping?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fear me not, man; I will not break away.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. But where's the money?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Five hundred ducats, villain, for rope?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou whoreson, senseless villain!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou art sensible in nothing but
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wilt thou still talk?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You minion, you, are these your customers?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Din'd at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not she herself revile me there?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not I in rage depart from thence?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Went'st not thou to her for purse of ducats?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O most unhappy strumpet!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Out on thee, villian! Wherefore
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I see these witches are afraid of swords.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I will not stay to-night for all the town;
ANGELO. I am sorry, sir, that I have hind'red you;
ANGELO. Of very reverend reputation, sir,
ANGELO. 'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think I had; I never did deny it.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art a villain to impeach me thus;
ANGELO. I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
ANGELO. Upon what cause?
ANGELO. See where they come; we will behold his death.
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, most gracious Duke; O, grant me justice!
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, sweet Prince, against that woman there!
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. This day, great Duke, she shut the doors upon me,
ANGELO. O peflur'd woman! They are both forsworn.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. My liege, I am advised what I say;
ANGELO. My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I, gentle mistress.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; I say nay to that.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. And so do I, yet did she call me so;
ANGELO. That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think it be, sir; I deny it not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
ANGELO. I think I did, sir; I deny it not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. This purse of ducats I receiv'd from you,

ANTONY. O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?
ANTONY. I doubt not of your wisdom.  
ANTONY. Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
ANTONY. Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed

ANTONY. Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.
ANTONY. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.

ANTONY. He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
ANTONY. This is a slight unmeritable man,

ANTONY. Ho, ho, ho!
ANTONY. Eros! mine armour, Eros!
ANTONY. No, my chuck. Eros! Come, mine armour, Eros!
ANTONY. Ah, let be, let be! Thou art
ANTONY. Well, well;
ANTONY. Rarely, rarely!
ANTONY. 'Tis well blown, lads.
ANTONY. Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
ANTONY. Who's gone this morning?
ANTONY. What say'st thou?
ANTONY. Is he gone?
ANTONY. Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;
ANTONY. Thou bleed'st apace.
ANTONY. They do retire.
ANTONY. I will reward thee
ANTONY. We have beat him to his camp. Run one before
ANTONY. Mine nightingale,
ANTONY. He has deserv'd it, were it carbuncled
ANTONY. Their preparation is to-day by sea;
ANTONY. I would they'd fight i' th' fire or i' th' air;
ANTONY. Yet they are not join'd. Where yond pine does stand
ANTONY. All is lost!
ANTONY. Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving
ANTONY. Eros, thou yet behold'st me?
ANTONY. Sometime we see a cloud that's dragonish;
ANTONY. That which is now a horse, even with a thought
ANTONY. My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
ANTONY. Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!
ANTONY. Dead then?
ANTONY. Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
ANTONY. Since Cleopatra died,
ANTONY. Eros,
ANTONY. Come, then; for with a wound I must be cur'd.  
ANTONY. When I did make thee free, swor'st thou not then
ANTONY. Lo thee!                            [Turning from him]
ANTONY. Then let it do at once
ANTONY. 'Tis said, man; and farewell.
ANTONY. Now, Eros.
ANTONY. Thrice nobler than myself!
ANTONY. I have done my work ill, friends. O, make an end
ANTONY. Let him that loves me, strike me dead.
ANTONY. Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword and give me
ANTONY. When did she send thee?  
ANTONY. Where is she?
ANTONY. Too late, good Diomed. Call my guard, I prithee.
ANTONY. Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;
ANTONY. Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate
ANTONY. Peace!
ANTONY. I am dying, Egypt, dying; only
ANTONY. O, quick, or I am gone.
ANTONY. I am dying, Egypt, dying.
ANTONY. One word, sweet queen:
ANTONY. Gentle, hear me:
ANTONY. The miserable change now at my end

ANGELO, a goldsmith
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Farewell till then. I will go lose myself,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He that commends me to mine own content
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Stop in your wind, sir; tell me this, I pray:
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I am not in a sportive humour now;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Now, as I am a Christian, answer me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy mistress' marks! What mistress, slave, hast thou?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Upon my life, by some device or other
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Even now, even here, not half an hour since.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Because that I familiarly sometimes
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Dost thou not know?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Shall I tell you why?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, first for flouting me; and then wherefore,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thank me, sir! for what?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I'll make you amends next, to
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In good time, sir, what's that?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Your reason?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, learn to jest in good time;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By what rule, sir?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Let's hear it.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. May he not do it by fine and recovery?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why is Time such a niggard of
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, but there's many a man
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, thou didst conclude hairy
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For what reason?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sound I pray you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Name them.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. You would all this time have prov'd there
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. But your reason was not substantial, why
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I knew 't'would be a bald conclusion. But,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By Dromio?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How can she thus, then, call us by our names,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think thou art in mind, and so am I.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou hast thine own form.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I think thou art an ass.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Y'are sad, Signior Balthazar; pray God our cheer
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And welcome more common; for that's nothing
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Who talks within there? Ho, open the door!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wherefore? For my dinner;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What art thou that keep'st me out
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do you hear, you minion? You'll let us in, I hope?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou baggage, let me in.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You'll cry for this, minion, if beat the door down.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Are you there, wife? You might
ANGELO. Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome; we would fain have either.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go fetch me something; I'll break ope the gate.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Well, I'll break in; go borrow me a crow.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You have prevail'd. I will depart in quiet,
ANGELO. I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do so; this jest shall cost me some expense.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Sweet mistress-what your name is else, I know not,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy sister's sister.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, how now, Dromio! Where run'st thou
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art Dromio, thou art my
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What woman's man, and how besides thyself?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What claim lays she to thee?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is she?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How dost thou mean a fat marriage?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What complexion is she of?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. That's a fault that water will mend.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What's her name?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Then she bears some breadth?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In what part of her body stands Ireland?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Scotland?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where France?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where England?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Spain?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where America, the Indies?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go hie thee presently post to the road;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's none but witches do inhabit here,
ANGELO. Master Antipholus!
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Ay, that's my name.
ANGELO. I know it well, sir. Lo, here is the chain.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is your will that I shall do with this?
ANGELO. What please yourself, sir; I have made it for you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.
ANGELO. Not once nor twice, but twenty times you have.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
ANGELO. You are a merry man, sir; fare you well.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What I should think of this cannot tell:
ANGELO. Even just the sum that I do owe to you
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. A man is well holp up that trusts to you!
ANGELO. Saving your merry humour, here's the note
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I am not furnish'd with the present money;
ANGELO. Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.
ANGELO. Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
ANGELO. Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
ANGELO. You hear how he importunes me-the chain!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money.
ANGELO. Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fie, now you run this humour out of breath!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I answer you! What should I answer you?
ANGELO. The money that you owe me for the chain.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I owe you none till I receive the chain.
ANGELO. You know I gave it you half an hour since.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You gave me none; you wrong me much to say so.
ANGELO. You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.
ANGELO. This touches me in reputation.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Consent to pay thee that I never had!
ANGELO. Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
ANGELO. Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. How now! a madman? Why, thou peevish sheep,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. THOU drunken slave! I sent the for a rope;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I Will debate this matter at more leisure,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I understand thee not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, thou mean'st an officer?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The fellow is distract, and so am I;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. It is the devil.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, Dromio?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avoid then, fiend! What tell'st thou me of supping?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fear me not, man; I will not break away.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. But where's the money?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Five hundred ducats, villain, for rope?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou whoreson, senseless villain!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou art sensible in nothing but
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wilt thou still talk?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You minion, you, are these your customers?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Din'd at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not she herself revile me there?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not I in rage depart from thence?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Went'st not thou to her for purse of ducats?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O most unhappy strumpet!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Out on thee, villian! Wherefore
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I see these witches are afraid of swords.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I will not stay to-night for all the town;
ANGELO. I am sorry, sir, that I have hind'red you;
ANGELO. Of very reverend reputation, sir,
ANGELO. 'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think I had; I never did deny it.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art a villain to impeach me thus;
ANGELO. I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
ANGELO. Upon what cause?
ANGELO. See where they come; we will behold his death.
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, most gracious Duke; O, grant me justice!
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, sweet Prince, against that woman there!
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. This day, great Duke, she shut the doors upon me,
ANGELO. O peflur'd woman! They are both forsworn.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. My liege, I am advised what I say;
ANGELO. My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
ANGELO. He had, my lord, and when he ran in here,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never came within these abbey walls,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. 'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw you in my life till now.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Neither.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw my father in my life.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. The Duke and all that know me in
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Aegeon, art thou not? or else his
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I, gentle mistress.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; I say nay to that.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. And so do I, yet did she call me so;
ANGELO. That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think it be, sir; I deny it not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
ANGELO. I think I did, sir; I deny it not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. This purse of ducats I receiv'd from you,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. These ducats pawn I for my father here.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There, take it; and much thanks for my
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio.

AN OLD LADY, friend to Anne Bullen
ANNE. Was he mad, sir?
ANNE. You are a merry gamester,
ANNE. You cannot show me.
ANNE. Not for that neither. Here's the pang that pinches:
ANNE. O, God's will! much better
ANNE. So much the more
ANNE. By my troth and maidenhead,
ANNE. Nay, good troth.
ANNE. No, not for all the riches under heaven.
ANNE. No, in truth.
ANNE. How you do talk!

ANNE. I do not know

ANNE. This is strange to me.
ANNE. Come, you are pleasant.
ANNE. Good lady,
ANTONY. Caesar, my lord?
ANTONY. I shall remember.
ANTONY. Caesar?
ANTONY. Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
ANTONY. So to most noble Caesar.
ANTONY. O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?
ANTONY. I doubt not of your wisdom.  
ANTONY. Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
ANTONY. Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed
ANTONY. That's all I seek;
ANTONY. Be it so,
ANTONY. O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
ANTONY. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
ANTONY. Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.
ANTONY. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.
ANTONY. For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
ANTONY. You gentle Romans-
ANTONY. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!
ANTONY. But yesterday the word of Caesar might
ANTONY. Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
ANTONY. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?
ANTONY. You will compel me then to read the will?
ANTONY. Nay, press not so upon me, stand far off.  
ANTONY. If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
ANTONY. Stay, countrymen.
ANTONY. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
ANTONY. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
ANTONY. Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.
ANTONY. Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
ANTONY. Hear me with patience.
ANTONY. Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
ANTONY. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
ANTONY. Where is he?
ANTONY. And thither will I straight to visit him.
ANTONY. Be like they had some notice of the people,
ANTONY. These many then shall die, their names are prick'd.
ANTONY. He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
ANTONY. This is a slight unmeritable man,
ANTONY. Octavius, I have seen more days than you,
ANTONY. So is my horse, Octavius, and for that
ANTONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
ANTONY. Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
ANTONY. Why do you cross me in this exigent?
ANTONY. No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
ANTONY. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
ANTONY. Not stingless too.
ANTONY. Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers
ANTONY. Old Cassius still!
ANTONY. Where is he?
ANTONY. This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,
ANTONY. This was the noblest Roman of them all.

ANGELO. Yet give leave, my lord,
ANGELO. The heavens give safety to your purposes!
ANGELO. 'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
ANGELO. We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
ANGELO. 'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
ANGELO. Where is the Provost?
ANGELO. See that Claudio  
ANGELO. How now, sir! What's your name, and what's the matter?
ANGELO. Benefactors! Well- what benefactors are they? Are they not
ANGELO. Go to; what quality are they of? Elbow is your name? Why
ANGELO. What are you, sir?
ANGELO. This will last out a night in Russia,
ANGELO. Now, what's the matter, Provost?
ANGELO. Did not I tell thee yea? Hadst thou not order?
ANGELO. Go to; let that be mine.
ANGELO. Dispose of her
ANGELO. Hath he a sister?
ANGELO. Well, let her be admitted.                Exit SERVANT
ANGELO. Stay a little while. [To ISABELLA] Y'are welcome; what's
ANGELO. Well; what's your suit?
ANGELO. Well; the matter?
ANGELO. Condemn the fault and not the actor of it!
ANGELO. Maiden, no remedy.
ANGELO. I will not do't.
ANGELO. Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.  
ANGELO. He's sentenc'd; 'tis too late.
ANGELO. Pray you be gone.
ANGELO. Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
ANGELO. Be you content, fair maid.
ANGELO. The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept.
ANGELO. I show it most of all when I show justice;
ANGELO. Why do you put these sayings upon me?
ANGELO. [Aside] She speaks, and 'tis
ANGELO. I will bethink me. Come again to-morrow.
ANGELO. How, bribe me?

ANGELO. I talk not of your soul; our compell'd sins
ANGELO. Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
ANGELO. Pleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul,
ANGELO. Nay, but hear me;
ANGELO. Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
ANGELO. And his offence is so, as it appears,  
ANGELO. Admit no other way to save his life,
ANGELO. Then must your brother die.  
ANGELO. Were not you, then, as cruel as the sentence
ANGELO. You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
ANGELO. We are all frail.
ANGELO. Nay, women are frail too.

ANGELO. Charges she moe than me?
ANGELO. This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.
ANGELO. My lord, I must confess I know this woman;
ANGELO. I did but smile till now.
ANGELO. What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
ANGELO. Hark how the villain would close now, after his treasonable

ANTONIO. In sooth, I know not why I am so sad.
ANTONIO. Believe me, no; I thank my fortune for it,

ANTONIO. Your worth is very dear in my regard.
ANTONIO. I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano-
ANTONIO. Fare you well; I'll grow a talker for this gear.  
ANTONIO. Is that anything now?
ANTONIO. Well; tell me now what lady is the same
ANTONIO. I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
ANTONIO. You know me well, and herein spend but time
ANTONIO. Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
ANTONIO. Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow
ANTONIO. And for three months.
ANTONIO. I do never use it.
ANTONIO. And what of him? Did he take interest?
ANTONIO. This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv'd for;
ANTONIO.  [Aside]  Mark you this, Bassanio,
ANTONIO. Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
ANTONIO. I am as like to call thee so again,
ANTONIO. Content, in faith; I'll seal to such a bond,
ANTONIO. Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it;
ANTONIO. Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
ANTONIO. Hie thee, gentle Jew.                    Exit SHYLOCK
ANTONIO. Come on; in this there can be no dismay;
ANTONIO. Who's there?  
ANTONIO. Fie, fie, Gratiano, where are all the rest?
ANTONIO. Hear me yet, good Shylock.
ANTONIO. I pray thee hear me speak.
ANTONIO. Let him alone;
ANTONIO. The Duke cannot deny the course of law;
ANTONIO. Ready, so please your Grace.
ANTONIO. I have heard
ANTONIO. I pray you, think you question with the Jew.
ANTONIO. I am a tainted wether of the flock,
ANTONIO. Ay, so he says.
ANTONIO. I do.
ANTONIO. Most heartily I do beseech the court  
ANTONIO. But little: I am arm'd and well prepar'd.
ANTONIO. So please my lord the Duke and all the court
ANTONIO. And stand indebted, over and above,
ANTONIO. My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring.
ANTONIO. No more than I am well acquitted of.
ANTONIO. I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels.
ANTONIO. I once did lend my body for his wealth,
ANTONIO. Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.
ANTONIO. I am dumb.
ANTONIO. Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;  
ANNE. The dinner is on the table; my father desires your

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Farewell till then. I will go lose myself,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He that commends me to mine own content
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Stop in your wind, sir; tell me this, I pray:
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I am not in a sportive humour now;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Now, as I am a Christian, answer me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy mistress' marks! What mistress, slave, hast thou?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Upon my life, by some device or other
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Even now, even here, not half an hour since.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Because that I familiarly sometimes
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Dost thou not know?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Shall I tell you why?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, first for flouting me; and then wherefore,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thank me, sir! for what?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I'll make you amends next, to
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In good time, sir, what's that?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Your reason?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, learn to jest in good time;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By what rule, sir?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Let's hear it.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. May he not do it by fine and recovery?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why is Time such a niggard of

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sound I pray you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Name them.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. You would all this time have prov'd there
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. But your reason was not substantial, why
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I knew 't'would be a bald conclusion. But,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By Dromio?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How can she thus, then, call us by our names,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think thou art in mind, and so am I.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou hast thine own form.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I think thou art an ass.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Y'are sad, Signior Balthazar; pray God our cheer
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And welcome more common; for that's nothing

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do you hear, you minion? You'll let us in, I hope?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou baggage, let me in.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You'll cry for this, minion, if beat the door down.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Are you there, wife? You might

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go fetch me something; I'll break ope the gate.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Well, I'll break in; go borrow me a crow.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You have prevail'd. I will depart in quiet,
ANGELO. I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do so; this jest shall cost me some expense.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Sweet mistress-what your name is else, I know not,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy sister's sister.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, how now, Dromio! Where run'st thou
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art Dromio, thou art my

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What claim lays she to thee?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is she?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How dost thou mean a fat marriage?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What complexion is she of?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. That's a fault that water will mend.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What's her name?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Then she bears some breadth?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In what part of her body stands Ireland?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Scotland?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where France?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where England?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Spain?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where America, the Indies?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Ay, that's my name.
ANGELO. I know it well, sir. Lo, here is the chain.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is your will that I shall do with this?
ANGELO. What please yourself, sir; I have made it for you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.
ANGELO. Not once nor twice, but twenty times you have.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
ANGELO. You are a merry man, sir; fare you well.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What I should think of this cannot tell:
ANGELO. Even just the sum that I do owe to you
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. A man is well holp up that trusts to you!
ANGELO. Saving your merry humour, here's the note
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I am not furnish'd with the present money;
ANGELO. Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.
ANGELO. Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
ANGELO. Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
ANGELO. You hear how he importunes me-the chain!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money.
ANGELO. Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fie, now you run this humour out of breath!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I answer you! What should I answer you?
ANGELO. The money that you owe me for the chain.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I owe you none till I receive the chain.
ANGELO. You know I gave it you half an hour since.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You gave me none; you wrong me much to say so.
ANGELO. You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.
ANGELO. This touches me in reputation.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Consent to pay thee that I never had!
ANGELO. Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
ANGELO. Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. How now! a madman? Why, thou peevish sheep,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. THOU drunken slave! I sent the for a rope;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I Will debate this matter at more leisure,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I understand thee not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, thou mean'st an officer?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The fellow is distract, and so am I;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. It is the devil.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, Dromio?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avoid then, fiend! What tell'st thou me of supping?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fear me not, man; I will not break away.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. But where's the money?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Five hundred ducats, villain, for rope?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou whoreson, senseless villain!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou art sensible in nothing but
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wilt thou still talk?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You minion, you, are these your customers?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Din'd at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not she herself revile me there?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not I in rage depart from thence?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Went'st not thou to her for purse of ducats?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O most unhappy strumpet!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Out on thee, villian! Wherefore
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I see these witches are afraid of swords.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I will not stay to-night for all the town;
ANGELO. I am sorry, sir, that I have hind'red you;
ANGELO. Of very reverend reputation, sir,
ANGELO. 'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think I had; I never did deny it.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art a villain to impeach me thus;
ANGELO. I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
ANGELO. Upon what cause?
ANGELO. See where they come; we will behold his death.
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, most gracious Duke; O, grant me justice!
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, sweet Prince, against that woman there!
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. This day, great Duke, she shut the doors upon me,
ANGELO. O peflur'd woman! They are both forsworn.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. My liege, I am advised what I say;
ANGELO. My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
ANGELO. He had, my lord, and when he ran in here,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never came within these abbey walls,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. 'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw you in my life till now.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Neither.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw my father in my life.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. The Duke and all that know me in
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Aegeon, art thou not? or else his
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I, gentle mistress.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; I say nay to that.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. And so do I, yet did she call me so;
ANGELO. That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think it be, sir; I deny it not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
ANGELO. I think I did, sir; I deny it not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. This purse of ducats I receiv'd from you,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. These ducats pawn I for my father here.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There, take it; and much thanks for my
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?

ANTONY. O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?
ANTONY. I doubt not of your wisdom.  
ANTONY. Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
ANTONY. Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed

ANTONY. Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.
ANTONY. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.
ANTONY. For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
ANTONY. You gentle Romans-
ANTONY. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!
ANTONY. But yesterday the word of Caesar might

ANTONY. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?
ANTONY. You will compel me then to read the will?
ANTONY. Nay, press not so upon me, stand far off.  
ANTONY. If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
ANTONY. Stay, countrymen.
ANTONY. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
ANTONY. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
ANTONY. Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.
ANTONY. Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
ANTONY. Hear me with patience.
ANTONY. Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
ANTONY. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
ANTONY. Where is he?
ANTONY. And thither will I straight to visit him.
ANTONY. Be like they had some notice of the people,
ANTONY. These many then shall die, their names are prick'd.
ANTONY. He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
ANTONY. This is a slight unmeritable man,
ANTONY. Octavius, I have seen more days than you,
ANTONY. So is my horse, Octavius, and for that
ANTONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
ANTONY. Octavius, lead your battle softly on,

ANTONY. No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.

ANTONY. Not stingless too.
ANTONY. Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers

ANTONY. What is his strength by land?
ANTONY. So is the fame.

ANTONY. Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?
ANTONY. If you can- your reason.  
ANTONY. Say to me,
ANTONY. Speak this no more.
ANTONY. Get thee gone.  
ANTONY. Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
ANTONY. Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
ANTONY. I have heard it, Pompey,
ANTONY. The beds i' th' East are soft; and thanks to you,
ANTONY. That will I, Pompey.
ANTONY. You have heard much.
ANTONY. And fair words to them.
ANTONY. [To CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o' th'

ANTONY. They are so.
ANTONY. It is shap'd, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it

ANTONY. 'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.
ANTONY. With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very

ANTONY. It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho!

ANTONY. Come, let's all take hands,
ANTONY. And shall, sir. Give's your hand.
ANTONY. No further, sir.
ANTONY. Make me not offended
ANTONY. You shall not find,
ANTONY. The April's in her eyes. It is love's spring,

ANTONY. Gentle Octavia,
ANTONY. When it appears to you where this begins,
ANTONY'S camp near Actium
ANTONY. Is it not strange, Canidius,
ANTONY. A good rebuke,
ANTONY. For that he dares us to't.
ANTONY. By sea, by sea.
ANTONY. I'll fight at sea.
ANTONY. Our overplus of shipping will we burn,
ANTONY. Can he be there in person? 'Tis impossible-
ANTONY. Well, well- away.
ANTONY. Set we our squadrons on yon side o' th' hill,
ANTONY. Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;
ANTONY. I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards
ANTONY. No, no, no, no, no.
ANTONY. O, fie, fie, fie!
ANTONY. Yes, my lord, yes. He at Philippi kept

ANTONY. Approach there.- Ah, you kite!- Now, gods and devils!
ANTONY. Moon and stars!
ANTONY. Tug him away. Being whipt,
ANTONY. You have been a boggler ever.
ANTONY. I found you as a morsel cold upon
ANTONY. To let a fellow that will take rewards,

ANTONY. If that thy father live, let him repent
ANTONY. Alack, our terrene moon
ANTONY. To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes
ANTONY. Cold-hearted toward me?
ANTONY. I am satisfied.
ANTONY. I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breath'd,
ANTONY. We will yet do well.
ANTONY. Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force

ANTONY. Why should he not?
ANTONY. To-morrow, soldier,

ANTONY. And thou art honest too.
ANTONY. Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night.
ANTONY. Tend me to-night;

ANTONY. Eros! mine armour, Eros!
ANTONY. No, my chuck. Eros! Come, mine armour, Eros!
ANTONY. Ah, let be, let be! Thou art

ANTONY. 'Tis well blown, lads.
ANTONY. Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
ANTONY. Who's gone this morning?
ANTONY. What say'st thou?
ANTONY. Is he gone?
ANTONY. Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;
ANTONY. Thou bleed'st apace.
ANTONY. They do retire.
ANTONY. I will reward thee
ANTONY. We have beat him to his camp. Run one before
ANTONY. Mine nightingale,
ANTONY. He has deserv'd it, were it carbuncled
ANTONY. Their preparation is to-day by sea;
ANTONY. I would they'd fight i' th' fire or i' th' air;
ANTONY. Yet they are not join'd. Where yond pine does stand
ANTONY. All is lost!
ANTONY. Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving
ANTONY. Eros, thou yet behold'st me?
ANTONY. Sometime we see a cloud that's dragonish;
ANTONY. That which is now a horse, even with a thought
ANTONY. My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
ANTONY. Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!
ANTONY. Dead then?
ANTONY. Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
ANTONY. Since Cleopatra died,
ANTONY. Eros,
ANTONY. Come, then; for with a wound I must be cur'd.  
ANTONY. When I did make thee free, swor'st thou not then
ANTONY. Lo thee!                            [Turning from him]
ANTONY. Then let it do at once
ANTONY. 'Tis said, man; and farewell.
ANTONY. Now, Eros.
ANTONY. Thrice nobler than myself!
ANTONY. I have done my work ill, friends. O, make an end
ANTONY. Let him that loves me, strike me dead.
ANTONY. Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword and give me
ANTONY. When did she send thee?  
ANTONY. Where is she?
ANTONY. Too late, good Diomed. Call my guard, I prithee.
ANTONY. Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;
ANTONY. Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate
ANTONY. Peace!
ANTONY. I am dying, Egypt, dying; only

ANTONY. I am dying, Egypt, dying.

ANGELO, a goldsmith
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Farewell till then. I will go lose myself,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He that commends me to mine own content
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Stop in your wind, sir; tell me this, I pray:
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I am not in a sportive humour now;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Now, as I am a Christian, answer me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy mistress' marks! What mistress, slave, hast thou?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Upon my life, by some device or other
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Even now, even here, not half an hour since.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Because that I familiarly sometimes
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Dost thou not know?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Shall I tell you why?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, first for flouting me; and then wherefore,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thank me, sir! for what?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I'll make you amends next, to
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In good time, sir, what's that?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Your reason?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, learn to jest in good time;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By what rule, sir?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Let's hear it.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. May he not do it by fine and recovery?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why is Time such a niggard of
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, but there's many a man
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, thou didst conclude hairy
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For what reason?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sound I pray you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Name them.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. You would all this time have prov'd there
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. But your reason was not substantial, why
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I knew 't'would be a bald conclusion. But,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By Dromio?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How can she thus, then, call us by our names,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think thou art in mind, and so am I.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou hast thine own form.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I think thou art an ass.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Y'are sad, Signior Balthazar; pray God our cheer
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And welcome more common; for that's nothing
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Who talks within there? Ho, open the door!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wherefore? For my dinner;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What art thou that keep'st me out
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do you hear, you minion? You'll let us in, I hope?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou baggage, let me in.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You'll cry for this, minion, if beat the door down.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Are you there, wife? You might
ANGELO. Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome; we would fain have either.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go fetch me something; I'll break ope the gate.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Well, I'll break in; go borrow me a crow.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You have prevail'd. I will depart in quiet,
ANGELO. I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do so; this jest shall cost me some expense.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Sweet mistress-what your name is else, I know not,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy sister's sister.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, how now, Dromio! Where run'st thou
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art Dromio, thou art my
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What woman's man, and how besides thyself?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What claim lays she to thee?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is she?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How dost thou mean a fat marriage?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What complexion is she of?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. That's a fault that water will mend.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What's her name?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Then she bears some breadth?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In what part of her body stands Ireland?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Scotland?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where France?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where England?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Spain?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where America, the Indies?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go hie thee presently post to the road;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's none but witches do inhabit here,
ANGELO. Master Antipholus!
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Ay, that's my name.
ANGELO. I know it well, sir. Lo, here is the chain.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is your will that I shall do with this?
ANGELO. What please yourself, sir; I have made it for you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.
ANGELO. Not once nor twice, but twenty times you have.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
ANGELO. You are a merry man, sir; fare you well.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What I should think of this cannot tell:
ANGELO. Even just the sum that I do owe to you
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. A man is well holp up that trusts to you!
ANGELO. Saving your merry humour, here's the note
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I am not furnish'd with the present money;
ANGELO. Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.
ANGELO. Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
ANGELO. Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
ANGELO. You hear how he importunes me-the chain!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money.
ANGELO. Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fie, now you run this humour out of breath!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I answer you! What should I answer you?
ANGELO. The money that you owe me for the chain.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I owe you none till I receive the chain.
ANGELO. You know I gave it you half an hour since.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You gave me none; you wrong me much to say so.
ANGELO. You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.
ANGELO. This touches me in reputation.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Consent to pay thee that I never had!
ANGELO. Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
ANGELO. Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. How now! a madman? Why, thou peevish sheep,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. THOU drunken slave! I sent the for a rope;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I Will debate this matter at more leisure,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I understand thee not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, thou mean'st an officer?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The fellow is distract, and so am I;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. It is the devil.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, Dromio?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avoid then, fiend! What tell'st thou me of supping?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fear me not, man; I will not break away.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. But where's the money?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Five hundred ducats, villain, for rope?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou whoreson, senseless villain!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou art sensible in nothing but
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wilt thou still talk?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You minion, you, are these your customers?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Din'd at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not she herself revile me there?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not I in rage depart from thence?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Went'st not thou to her for purse of ducats?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O most unhappy strumpet!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Out on thee, villian! Wherefore
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I see these witches are afraid of swords.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I will not stay to-night for all the town;
ANGELO. I am sorry, sir, that I have hind'red you;
ANGELO. Of very reverend reputation, sir,
ANGELO. 'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think I had; I never did deny it.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art a villain to impeach me thus;
ANGELO. I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
ANGELO. Upon what cause?
ANGELO. See where they come; we will behold his death.
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, most gracious Duke; O, grant me justice!
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, sweet Prince, against that woman there!
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. This day, great Duke, she shut the doors upon me,
ANGELO. O peflur'd woman! They are both forsworn.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. My liege, I am advised what I say;
ANGELO. My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
ANGELO. He had, my lord, and when he ran in here,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never came within these abbey walls,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. 'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw you in my life till now.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Neither.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw my father in my life.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. The Duke and all that know me in
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Aegeon, art thou not? or else his
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I, gentle mistress.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; I say nay to that.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. And so do I, yet did she call me so;
ANGELO. That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think it be, sir; I deny it not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
ANGELO. I think I did, sir; I deny it not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. This purse of ducats I receiv'd from you,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. These ducats pawn I for my father here.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There, take it; and much thanks for my
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio.

ANNE. O, God's will! much better
ANNE. So much the more
ANNE. By my troth and maidenhead,
ANNE. Nay, good troth.
ANNE. No, not for all the riches under heaven.

ANNE. Good lady,
ANTONY. Caesar, my lord?
ANTONY. I shall remember.
ANTONY. Caesar?
ANTONY. Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
ANTONY. So to most noble Caesar.
ANTONY. O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?
ANTONY. I doubt not of your wisdom.  
ANTONY. Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
ANTONY. Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed
ANTONY. That's all I seek;
ANTONY. Be it so,
ANTONY. O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
ANTONY. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
ANTONY. Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.
ANTONY. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.
ANTONY. For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
ANTONY. You gentle Romans-
ANTONY. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!
ANTONY. But yesterday the word of Caesar might
ANTONY. Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
ANTONY. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?
ANTONY. You will compel me then to read the will?
ANTONY. Nay, press not so upon me, stand far off.  
ANTONY. If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
ANTONY. Stay, countrymen.
ANTONY. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
ANTONY. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
ANTONY. Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.
ANTONY. Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
ANTONY. Hear me with patience.
ANTONY. Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
ANTONY. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
ANTONY. Where is he?
ANTONY. And thither will I straight to visit him.
ANTONY. Be like they had some notice of the people,
ANTONY. These many then shall die, their names are prick'd.
ANTONY. He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
ANTONY. This is a slight unmeritable man,
ANTONY. Octavius, I have seen more days than you,
ANTONY. So is my horse, Octavius, and for that
ANTONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
ANTONY. Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
ANTONY. Why do you cross me in this exigent?
ANTONY. No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
ANTONY. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
ANTONY. Not stingless too.
ANTONY. Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers
ANTONY. Old Cassius still!
ANTONY. Where is he?
ANTONY. This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,
ANTONY. This was the noblest Roman of them all.

ANGELO. Pleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul,
ANGELO. Nay, but hear me;
ANGELO. Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
ANGELO. And his offence is so, as it appears,  
ANGELO. Admit no other way to save his life,
ANGELO. Then must your brother die.  
ANGELO. Were not you, then, as cruel as the sentence
ANGELO. You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;

ANGELO. Nay, women are frail too.

ANGELO. You make my bonds still greater.
ANGELO. My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm;
ANGELO. And she will speak most bitterly and strange.
ANGELO. Charges she moe than me?
ANGELO. This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.
ANGELO. My lord, I must confess I know this woman;
ANGELO. I did but smile till now.
ANGELO. What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
ANGELO. Hark how the villain would close now, after his treasonable

ANTONIO. I do never use it.
ANTONIO. And what of him? Did he take interest?
ANTONIO. This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv'd for;
ANTONIO.  [Aside]  Mark you this, Bassanio,
ANTONIO. Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
ANTONIO. I am as like to call thee so again,
ANTONIO. Content, in faith; I'll seal to such a bond,
ANTONIO. Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it;
ANTONIO. Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
ANTONIO. Hie thee, gentle Jew.                    Exit SHYLOCK
ANTONIO. Come on; in this there can be no dismay;
ANTONIO. Who's there?  
ANTONIO. Fie, fie, Gratiano, where are all the rest?
ANTONIO. Hear me yet, good Shylock.
ANTONIO. I pray thee hear me speak.
ANTONIO. Let him alone;
ANTONIO. The Duke cannot deny the course of law;
ANTONIO. Ready, so please your Grace.
ANTONIO. I have heard
ANTONIO. I pray you, think you question with the Jew.
ANTONIO. I am a tainted wether of the flock,

ANTONIO. I do.

ANTONIO. But little: I am arm'd and well prepar'd.
ANTONIO. So please my lord the Duke and all the court
ANTONIO. And stand indebted, over and above,
ANTONIO. My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring.
ANTONIO. No more than I am well acquitted of.
ANTONIO. I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels.

ANNE. Now, Master Slender-
ANNE. What is your will?
ANNE. I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?
ANNE. Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.
ANNE. Alas, I had rather be set quick i' th' earth.
ANNE. Pardon, good father. Good my mother, pardon.
ANOTHER LORD. I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;
ANNE. Set down, set down your honourable load-
ANNE. What black magician conjures up this fiend
ANNE. What, do you tremble? Are you all afraid?
ANNE. Foul devil, for God's sake, hence and trouble us not;
ANNE. Villain, thou knowest nor law of God nor man:
ANNE. O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!

ANNE. That shalt thou know hereafter.
ANNE. All men, I hope, live so.
ANNE. To take is not to give.               [Puts on the ring]
ANNE. What is it?
ANNE. With all my heart; and much it joys me too
ANNE. 'Tis more than you deserve;
ANNE, DUCHESS of GLOUCESTER, leading LADY MARGARET PLANTAGENET,
ANNE. God give your Graces both
ANNE. No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,
ANNE. Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother.
ANNE. Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!
ANNE. And I with all unwillingness will go.
ANNE. No, why? When he that is my husband now
ANNE. No more than with my soul I mourn for yours.
ANNE. Adieu, poor soul, that tak'st thy leave of it!

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I am not in a sportive humour now;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Now, as I am a Christian, answer me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy mistress' marks! What mistress, slave, hast thou?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I'll make you amends next, to

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Your reason?

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Name them.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. You would all this time have prov'd there

ANGELO. I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do so; this jest shall cost me some expense.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Sweet mistress-what your name is else, I know not,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy sister's sister.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, how now, Dromio! Where run'st thou
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art Dromio, thou art my
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What woman's man, and how besides thyself?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What claim lays she to thee?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is she?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How dost thou mean a fat marriage?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What complexion is she of?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. That's a fault that water will mend.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What's her name?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Then she bears some breadth?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In what part of her body stands Ireland?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Scotland?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where France?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where England?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Spain?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where America, the Indies?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go hie thee presently post to the road;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's none but witches do inhabit here,
ANGELO. Master Antipholus!
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Ay, that's my name.
ANGELO. I know it well, sir. Lo, here is the chain.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is your will that I shall do with this?
ANGELO. What please yourself, sir; I have made it for you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.
ANGELO. Not once nor twice, but twenty times you have.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
ANGELO. You are a merry man, sir; fare you well.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What I should think of this cannot tell:
ANGELO. Even just the sum that I do owe to you
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. A man is well holp up that trusts to you!
ANGELO. Saving your merry humour, here's the note
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I am not furnish'd with the present money;
ANGELO. Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.
ANGELO. Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
ANGELO. Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
ANGELO. You hear how he importunes me-the chain!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money.
ANGELO. Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fie, now you run this humour out of breath!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I answer you! What should I answer you?
ANGELO. The money that you owe me for the chain.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I owe you none till I receive the chain.
ANGELO. You know I gave it you half an hour since.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You gave me none; you wrong me much to say so.
ANGELO. You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.
ANGELO. This touches me in reputation.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Consent to pay thee that I never had!
ANGELO. Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
ANGELO. Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. How now! a madman? Why, thou peevish sheep,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. THOU drunken slave! I sent the for a rope;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I Will debate this matter at more leisure,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I understand thee not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, thou mean'st an officer?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The fellow is distract, and so am I;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. It is the devil.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, Dromio?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avoid then, fiend! What tell'st thou me of supping?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fear me not, man; I will not break away.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. But where's the money?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Five hundred ducats, villain, for rope?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou whoreson, senseless villain!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou art sensible in nothing but
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wilt thou still talk?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You minion, you, are these your customers?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Din'd at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not she herself revile me there?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not I in rage depart from thence?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Went'st not thou to her for purse of ducats?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O most unhappy strumpet!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Out on thee, villian! Wherefore
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I see these witches are afraid of swords.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I will not stay to-night for all the town;
ANGELO. I am sorry, sir, that I have hind'red you;
ANGELO. Of very reverend reputation, sir,
ANGELO. 'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think I had; I never did deny it.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art a villain to impeach me thus;
ANGELO. I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
ANGELO. Upon what cause?
ANGELO. See where they come; we will behold his death.
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, most gracious Duke; O, grant me justice!
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, sweet Prince, against that woman there!
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. This day, great Duke, she shut the doors upon me,
ANGELO. O peflur'd woman! They are both forsworn.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. My liege, I am advised what I say;
ANGELO. My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
ANGELO. He had, my lord, and when he ran in here,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never came within these abbey walls,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. 'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw you in my life till now.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Neither.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw my father in my life.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. The Duke and all that know me in
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Aegeon, art thou not? or else his
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I, gentle mistress.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; I say nay to that.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. And so do I, yet did she call me so;
ANGELO. That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think it be, sir; I deny it not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
ANGELO. I think I did, sir; I deny it not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. This purse of ducats I receiv'd from you,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. These ducats pawn I for my father here.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There, take it; and much thanks for my
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio.

ANNE. So much the more

ANTONY. I shall remember.
ANTONY. Caesar?
ANTONY. Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
ANTONY. So to most noble Caesar.
ANTONY. O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?
ANTONY. I doubt not of your wisdom.  
ANTONY. Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
ANTONY. Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed
ANTONY. That's all I seek;
ANTONY. Be it so,
ANTONY. O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
ANTONY. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
ANTONY. Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.
ANTONY. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.
ANTONY. For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
ANTONY. You gentle Romans-
ANTONY. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!
ANTONY. But yesterday the word of Caesar might
ANTONY. Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
ANTONY. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?
ANTONY. You will compel me then to read the will?
ANTONY. Nay, press not so upon me, stand far off.  
ANTONY. If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
ANTONY. Stay, countrymen.
ANTONY. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
ANTONY. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
ANTONY. Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.
ANTONY. Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
ANTONY. Hear me with patience.
ANTONY. Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
ANTONY. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
ANTONY. Where is he?
ANTONY. And thither will I straight to visit him.
ANTONY. Be like they had some notice of the people,
ANTONY. These many then shall die, their names are prick'd.
ANTONY. He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
ANTONY. This is a slight unmeritable man,
ANTONY. Octavius, I have seen more days than you,
ANTONY. So is my horse, Octavius, and for that
ANTONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
ANTONY. Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
ANTONY. Why do you cross me in this exigent?
ANTONY. No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
ANTONY. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.
ANTONY. Not stingless too.
ANTONY. Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers
ANTONY. Old Cassius still!
ANTONY. Where is he?
ANTONY. This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,

ANGELO. Pray you be gone.
ANGELO. Your brother is a forfeit of the law,

ANTONIO. Sebastian are you?
ANTONIO. How have you made division of yourself?
ANTONIO, father to Proteus
ANTONIO. Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that
ANTONIO. Why, what of him?
ANTONIO. Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
ANTONIO. I know it well.
ANTONIO. I like thy counsel; well hast thou advis'd;
ANTONIO. Good company; with them shall Proteus go.
ANTONIO. How now! What letter are you reading there?
ANTONIO. Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
ANTONIO. And how stand you affected to his wish?
ANTONIO. My will is something sorted with his wish.

ANTIGONUS.  [Aside]  To laughter, as I take it,  
ANTIGONUS. That's enough.  
ANTIGONUS. I told her so, my lord,
ANTIGONUS. La you now, you hear!
ANTIGONUS. I am none, by this good light.
ANTIGONUS. Hang all the husbands  
ANTIGONUS. I did not, sir.
ANTIGONUS. Anything, my lord,  
ANTIGONUS. I will, my lord.
ANTIGONUS. I swear to do this, though a present death
ANTIGONUS. Thou art perfect then our ship hath touch'd upon
ANTIGONUS. Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;
ANTIGONUS. Go thou away;
ANTIGONUS. Come, poor babe.
ANTONY. There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
ANTONY. Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.
ANTONY. Grates me the sum.
ANTONY. How, my love?
ANTONY. Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
ANTONY. But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
ANTONY. Fie, wrangling queen!
ANTONY. Against my brother Lucius?
ANTONY. Well, what worst?
ANTONY. When it concerns the fool or coward. On!
ANTONY. Antony, thou wouldst say.
ANTONY. Speak to me home; mince not the general tongue;
ANTONY. From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!
ANTONY. Let him appear.

ANTONY. Forbear me.                             Exit MESSENGER
ANTONY. I must with haste from hence.
ANTONY. I must be gone.
ANTONY. She is cunning past man's thought.
ANTONY. Would I had never seen her!

ANTONY. Dead.
ANTONY. The business she hath broached in the state

ANTONY. What's the matter?
ANTONY. The gods best know-
ANTONY. Cleopatra-
ANTONY. Most sweet queen-
ANTONY. How now, lady!
ANTONY. Hear me, queen:
ANTONY. She's dead, my Queen.
ANTONY. Quarrel no more, but be prepar'd to know
ANTONY. My precious queen, forbear,
ANTONY. You'll heat my blood; no more.
ANTONY. Now, by my sword-
ANTONY. I'll leave you, lady.
ANTONY. But that your royalty
ANTONY. Let us go. Come.
ANTONY. If we compose well here, to Parthia.
ANTONY. 'Tis spoken well.
ANTONY. Thank you.
ANTONY. Sit, sir.
ANTONY. I learn you take things ill which are not so,
ANTONY. My being in Egypt, Caesar,
ANTONY. How intend you- practis'd?
ANTONY. You do mistake your business; my brother never
ANTONY. Not so, not so;
ANTONY. So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,
ANTONY. Sir,
ANTONY. No;
ANTONY. Neglected, rather;  
ANTONY. Thou art a soldier only. Speak no more.  
ANTONY. You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
ANTONY. I am not married, Caesar. Let me hear
ANTONY. Will Caesar speak?
ANTONY. What power is in Agrippa,
ANTONY. May I never
ANTONY. I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;
ANTONY. Where lies he?
ANTONY. What is his strength by land?
ANTONY. So is the fame.
ANTONY. Let us, Lepidus,

ANTONY. Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?
ANTONY. If you can- your reason.  
ANTONY. Say to me,
ANTONY. Speak this no more.
ANTONY. Get thee gone.  
ANTONY. Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
ANTONY. Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
ANTONY. I have heard it, Pompey,
ANTONY. The beds i' th' East are soft; and thanks to you,
ANTONY. That will I, Pompey.
ANTONY. You have heard much.
ANTONY. And fair words to them.
ANTONY. [To CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o' th'
ANTONY. Ay, Lepidus.
ANTONY. They are so.
ANTONY. It is shap'd, sir, like itself, and it is as broad as it

ANTONY. 'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.
ANTONY. With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very
ANTONY. These quicksands, Lepidus,

ANTONY. It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho!
ANTONY. Be a child o' th' time.
ANTONY. Come, let's all take hands,
ANTONY. And shall, sir. Give's your hand.
ANTONY. No further, sir.
ANTONY. Make me not offended

ANTONY. Farewell!                       Trumpets sound. Exeunt
ANTONY. Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that-
ANTONY. Gentle Octavia,
ANTONY. When it appears to you where this begins,
ANTONY'S camp near Actium
ANTONY. Is it not strange, Canidius,
ANTONY. A good rebuke,
ANTONY. For that he dares us to't.
ANTONY. By sea, by sea.
ANTONY. I'll fight at sea.
ANTONY. Our overplus of shipping will we burn,
ANTONY. Can he be there in person? 'Tis impossible-
ANTONY. Well, well- away.
ANTONY. Set we our squadrons on yon side o' th' hill,
ANTONY. Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;
ANTONY. I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards
ANTONY. No, no, no, no, no.
ANTONY. O, fie, fie, fie!
ANTONY. Yes, my lord, yes. He at Philippi kept
ANTONY. I have offended reputation-
ANTONY. O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See
ANTONY. Egypt, thou knew'st too well
ANTONY. Now I must

ANTONY. Approach there.- Ah, you kite!- Now, gods and devils!
ANTONY. Moon and stars!
ANTONY. Tug him away. Being whipt,
ANTONY. You have been a boggler ever.
ANTONY. I found you as a morsel cold upon
ANTONY. To let a fellow that will take rewards,
ANTONY. Cried he? and begg'd 'a pardon?
ANTONY. If that thy father live, let him repent
ANTONY. Alack, our terrene moon
ANTONY. To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes
ANTONY. Cold-hearted toward me?
ANTONY. I am satisfied.
ANTONY. I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breath'd,
ANTONY. We will yet do well.
ANTONY. Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
ANTONY. He will not fight with me, Domitius?
ANTONY. Why should he not?
ANTONY. To-morrow, soldier,
ANTONY. Well said; come on.
ANTONY. And thou art honest too.
ANTONY. Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night.
ANTONY. Tend me to-night;
ANTONY. Ho, ho, ho!
ANTONY. Eros! mine armour, Eros!
ANTONY. No, my chuck. Eros! Come, mine armour, Eros!
ANTONY. Ah, let be, let be! Thou art
ANTONY. Well, well;
ANTONY. Rarely, rarely!
ANTONY. 'Tis well blown, lads.
ANTONY. Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
ANTONY. Who's gone this morning?
ANTONY. What say'st thou?
ANTONY. Is he gone?
ANTONY. Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;
ANTONY. Thou bleed'st apace.
ANTONY. They do retire.
ANTONY. I will reward thee
ANTONY. We have beat him to his camp. Run one before
ANTONY. Mine nightingale,
ANTONY. He has deserv'd it, were it carbuncled
ANTONY. Their preparation is to-day by sea;
ANTONY. I would they'd fight i' th' fire or i' th' air;
ANTONY. Yet they are not join'd. Where yond pine does stand
ANTONY. All is lost!
ANTONY. Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving
ANTONY. Eros, thou yet behold'st me?
ANTONY. Sometime we see a cloud that's dragonish;
ANTONY. That which is now a horse, even with a thought
ANTONY. My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
ANTONY. Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!
ANTONY. Dead then?
ANTONY. Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
ANTONY. Since Cleopatra died,
ANTONY. Eros,
ANTONY. Come, then; for with a wound I must be cur'd.  
ANTONY. When I did make thee free, swor'st thou not then
ANTONY. Lo thee!                            [Turning from him]
ANTONY. Then let it do at once
ANTONY. 'Tis said, man; and farewell.
ANTONY. Now, Eros.
ANTONY. Thrice nobler than myself!
ANTONY. I have done my work ill, friends. O, make an end
ANTONY. Let him that loves me, strike me dead.
ANTONY. Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword and give me
ANTONY. When did she send thee?  
ANTONY. Where is she?
ANTONY. Too late, good Diomed. Call my guard, I prithee.
ANTONY. Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;
ANTONY. Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate
ANTONY. Peace!
ANTONY. I am dying, Egypt, dying; only
ANTONY. O, quick, or I am gone.
ANTONY. I am dying, Egypt, dying.
ANTONY. One word, sweet queen:
ANTONY. Gentle, hear me:
ANTONY. The miserable change now at my end

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Aegion and Aemelia
ANGELO, a goldsmith
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Farewell till then. I will go lose myself,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He that commends me to mine own content
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Stop in your wind, sir; tell me this, I pray:
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I am not in a sportive humour now;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Now, as I am a Christian, answer me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy mistress' marks! What mistress, slave, hast thou?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Upon my life, by some device or other
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Even now, even here, not half an hour since.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Because that I familiarly sometimes
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Dost thou not know?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Shall I tell you why?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, first for flouting me; and then wherefore,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thank me, sir! for what?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I'll make you amends next, to
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In good time, sir, what's that?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Your reason?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, learn to jest in good time;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By what rule, sir?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Let's hear it.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. May he not do it by fine and recovery?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why is Time such a niggard of
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, but there's many a man
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, thou didst conclude hairy
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For what reason?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sound I pray you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Name them.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. You would all this time have prov'd there
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. But your reason was not substantial, why
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I knew 't'would be a bald conclusion. But,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By Dromio?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How can she thus, then, call us by our names,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think thou art in mind, and so am I.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou hast thine own form.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I think thou art an ass.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Y'are sad, Signior Balthazar; pray God our cheer
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And welcome more common; for that's nothing
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Who talks within there? Ho, open the door!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wherefore? For my dinner;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What art thou that keep'st me out
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do you hear, you minion? You'll let us in, I hope?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou baggage, let me in.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You'll cry for this, minion, if beat the door down.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Are you there, wife? You might
ANGELO. Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome; we would fain have either.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go fetch me something; I'll break ope the gate.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Well, I'll break in; go borrow me a crow.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You have prevail'd. I will depart in quiet,
ANGELO. I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do so; this jest shall cost me some expense.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Sweet mistress-what your name is else, I know not,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy sister's sister.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, how now, Dromio! Where run'st thou
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art Dromio, thou art my
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What woman's man, and how besides thyself?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What claim lays she to thee?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is she?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How dost thou mean a fat marriage?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What complexion is she of?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. That's a fault that water will mend.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What's her name?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Then she bears some breadth?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In what part of her body stands Ireland?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Scotland?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where France?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where England?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Spain?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where America, the Indies?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go hie thee presently post to the road;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's none but witches do inhabit here,
ANGELO. Master Antipholus!
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Ay, that's my name.
ANGELO. I know it well, sir. Lo, here is the chain.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is your will that I shall do with this?
ANGELO. What please yourself, sir; I have made it for you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.
ANGELO. Not once nor twice, but twenty times you have.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
ANGELO. You are a merry man, sir; fare you well.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What I should think of this cannot tell:
ANGELO. Even just the sum that I do owe to you
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. A man is well holp up that trusts to you!
ANGELO. Saving your merry humour, here's the note
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I am not furnish'd with the present money;
ANGELO. Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.
ANGELO. Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
ANGELO. Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
ANGELO. You hear how he importunes me-the chain!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money.
ANGELO. Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fie, now you run this humour out of breath!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I answer you! What should I answer you?
ANGELO. The money that you owe me for the chain.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I owe you none till I receive the chain.
ANGELO. You know I gave it you half an hour since.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You gave me none; you wrong me much to say so.
ANGELO. You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.
ANGELO. This touches me in reputation.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Consent to pay thee that I never had!
ANGELO. Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
ANGELO. Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. How now! a madman? Why, thou peevish sheep,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. THOU drunken slave! I sent the for a rope;
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I Will debate this matter at more leisure,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I understand thee not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, thou mean'st an officer?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The fellow is distract, and so am I;
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. It is the devil.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, Dromio?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avoid then, fiend! What tell'st thou me of supping?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fear me not, man; I will not break away.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. But where's the money?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Five hundred ducats, villain, for rope?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou whoreson, senseless villain!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou art sensible in nothing but
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wilt thou still talk?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You minion, you, are these your customers?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Din'd at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not she herself revile me there?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not I in rage depart from thence?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Went'st not thou to her for purse of ducats?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O most unhappy strumpet!
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Out on thee, villian! Wherefore
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I see these witches are afraid of swords.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I will not stay to-night for all the town;
ANGELO. I am sorry, sir, that I have hind'red you;
ANGELO. Of very reverend reputation, sir,
ANGELO. 'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think I had; I never did deny it.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art a villain to impeach me thus;
ANGELO. I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
ANGELO. Upon what cause?
ANGELO. See where they come; we will behold his death.
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, most gracious Duke; O, grant me justice!
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, sweet Prince, against that woman there!
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. This day, great Duke, she shut the doors upon me,
ANGELO. O peflur'd woman! They are both forsworn.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. My liege, I am advised what I say;
ANGELO. My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
ANGELO. He had, my lord, and when he ran in here,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never came within these abbey walls,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. 'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw you in my life till now.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Neither.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw my father in my life.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. The Duke and all that know me in
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Aegeon, art thou not? or else his
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I, gentle mistress.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; I say nay to that.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. And so do I, yet did she call me so;
ANGELO. That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think it be, sir; I deny it not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
ANGELO. I think I did, sir; I deny it not.
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. This purse of ducats I receiv'd from you,
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. These ducats pawn I for my father here.
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There, take it; and much thanks for my
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio.
AN OLD SHEPHERD, father to Joan la Pucelle
ANNE BULLEN, her Maid of Honour, afterwards Queen
AN OLD LADY, friend to Anne Bullen
ANNE. Was he mad, sir?
ANNE. You are a merry gamester,
ANNE. You cannot show me.
ANNE. Not for that neither. Here's the pang that pinches:
ANNE. O, God's will! much better
ANNE. So much the more
ANNE. By my troth and maidenhead,
ANNE. Nay, good troth.
ANNE. No, not for all the riches under heaven.
ANNE. No, in truth.
ANNE. How you do talk!
ANNE. My good lord,
ANNE. Now, I pray God, amen!
ANNE. I do not know
ANNE. My honour'd lord!                       Exit LORD CHAMBERLAIN
ANNE. This is strange to me.
ANNE. Come, you are pleasant.
ANNE. Good lady,
ANTONY. Caesar, my lord?
ANTONY. I shall remember.
ANTONY. Caesar?
ANTONY. Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
ANTONY. So to most noble Caesar.
ANTONY. O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?
ANTONY. I doubt not of your wisdom.  
ANTONY. Pardon me, Caius Cassius.
ANTONY. Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed
ANTONY. That's all I seek;
ANTONY. Be it so,
ANTONY. O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
ANTONY. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
ANTONY. Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.
ANTONY. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.
ANTONY. For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
ANTONY. You gentle Romans-
ANTONY. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!
ANTONY. But yesterday the word of Caesar might
ANTONY. Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;

ARMADO. It doth amount to one more than two.
ARMADO. True.
ARMADO. A most fine figure!
ARMADO. I will hereupon confess I am in love. And as it is base for
ARMADO. Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more;  
ARMADO. O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do excel thee
ARMADO. Of what complexion?
ARMADO. Tell me precisely of what complexion.
ARMADO. Is that one of the four complexions?
ARMADO. Green, indeed, is the colour of lovers; but to have a love
ARMADO. My love is most immaculate white and red.  
ARMADO. Define, define, well-educated infant.
ARMADO. Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty, and pathetical!
ARMADO. Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?
ARMADO. I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may
ARMADO. Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.
ARMADO. I say, sing.
ARMADO. I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!
ARMADO. I will visit thee at the lodge.
ARMADO. I know where it is situate.
ARMADO. I will tell thee wonders.
ARMADO. I love thee.
ARMADO. And so, farewell.
ARMADO. Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be
ARMADO. Thou shalt be heavily punished.
ARMADO. Take away this villain; shut him up.
ARMADO. I do affect the very ground, which is base, where her shoe,
ARMADO. Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.
ARMADO. Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years, take this key, give

ARMADO. But O- but O-
ARMADO. Call'st thou my love 'hobby-horse'?
ARMADO. Almost I had.
ARMADO. By heart and in heart, boy.
ARMADO. What wilt thou prove?
ARMADO. I am all these three.  
ARMADO. Fetch hither the swain; he must carry me a letter.
ARMADO. Ha, ha, what sayest thou?
ARMADO. The way is but short; away.
ARMADO. The meaning, pretty ingenious?
ARMADO. I say lead is slow.
ARMADO. Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
ARMADO. A most acute juvenal; volable and free of grace!  
ARMADO. Some enigma, some riddle; come, thy l'envoy; begin.
ARMADO. By virtue thou enforcest laughter; thy silly thought, my

ARMADO. But tell me: how was there a costard broken in a shin?
ARMADO. We will talk no more of this matter.
ARMADO. Sirrah Costard. I will enfranchise thee.
ARMADO. By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,

ARMADO. This Hector far surmounted Hannibal-
ARMADO. What meanest thou?
ARMADO. Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? Thou shalt die.
ARMADO. By the North Pole, I do challenge thee.
ARMADO. Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat in my  
ARMADO. Sweet bloods, I both may and will.
ARMADO. The naked truth of it is: I have no shirt; I go woolward
ARMADO. For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have seen the
ARMADO. Sweet Majesty, vouchsafe me-

ARCHIDAMUS. If the King had no son, they would desire to live on
ARVIRAGUS. Hail, heaven!
ARVIRAGUS. What should we speak of
ARVIRAGUS. I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.
ARVIRAGUS. All gold and silver rather turn to dirt,
ARVIRAGUS. I'll make't my comfort
ARVIRAGUS. Or I, whate'er it be,  
ARVIRAGUS. The night to th' owl and morn to th' lark less welcome.
ARVIRAGUS. I pray draw near.                            Exeunt

ARCHBISHOP. No, no, my lord. Note this: the King is weary
ARCHBISHOP. 'Tis very true;
ARCHBISHOP. Before, and greet his Grace. My lord, we come.
ARCHBISHOP. Good my Lord of Lancaster,
ARCHBISHOP. I take your princely word for these redresses.
ARCHBISHOP. To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.  
ARCHBISHOP. I do not doubt you.
ARCHBISHOP. Against ill chances men are ever merry;

ARTHUR. Alas, I then have chid away my friend!
ARTHUR. Is there no remedy?

ARTHUR. An if you do, you will but make it blush
ARTHUR. O, now you look like Hubert! All this while

ARMADO. It doth amount to one more than two.
ARMADO. True.
ARMADO. A most fine figure!
ARMADO. I will hereupon confess I am in love. And as it is base for
ARMADO. Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more;  
ARMADO. O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do excel thee
ARMADO. Of what complexion?
ARMADO. Tell me precisely of what complexion.
ARMADO. Is that one of the four complexions?
ARMADO. Green, indeed, is the colour of lovers; but to have a love
ARMADO. My love is most immaculate white and red.  
ARMADO. Define, define, well-educated infant.
ARMADO. Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty, and pathetical!
ARMADO. Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?
ARMADO. I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may
ARMADO. Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.
ARMADO. I say, sing.
ARMADO. I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!
ARMADO. I will visit thee at the lodge.
ARMADO. I know where it is situate.
ARMADO. I will tell thee wonders.
ARMADO. I love thee.
ARMADO. And so, farewell.
ARMADO. Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be
ARMADO. Thou shalt be heavily punished.
ARMADO. Take away this villain; shut him up.
ARMADO. I do affect the very ground, which is base, where her shoe,
ARMADO. Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.
ARMADO. Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years, take this key, give

ARMADO. But O- but O-
ARMADO. Call'st thou my love 'hobby-horse'?
ARMADO. Almost I had.
ARMADO. By heart and in heart, boy.
ARMADO. What wilt thou prove?
ARMADO. I am all these three.  
ARMADO. Fetch hither the swain; he must carry me a letter.
ARMADO. Ha, ha, what sayest thou?
ARMADO. The way is but short; away.
ARMADO. The meaning, pretty ingenious?
ARMADO. I say lead is slow.
ARMADO. Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
ARMADO. A most acute juvenal; volable and free of grace!  
ARMADO. Some enigma, some riddle; come, thy l'envoy; begin.
ARMADO. By virtue thou enforcest laughter; thy silly thought, my

ARMADO. But tell me: how was there a costard broken in a shin?
ARMADO. We will talk no more of this matter.
ARMADO. Sirrah Costard. I will enfranchise thee.
ARMADO. By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,

ARMADO. This Hector far surmounted Hannibal-
ARMADO. What meanest thou?
ARMADO. Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? Thou shalt die.
ARMADO. By the North Pole, I do challenge thee.
ARMADO. Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat in my  
ARMADO. Sweet bloods, I both may and will.
ARMADO. The naked truth of it is: I have no shirt; I go woolward
ARMADO. For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have seen the
ARMADO. Sweet Majesty, vouchsafe me-

ARCHIDAMUS. If the King had no son, they would desire to live on
ARVIRAGUS. Hail, heaven!
ARVIRAGUS. What should we speak of
ARVIRAGUS. I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.
ARVIRAGUS. All gold and silver rather turn to dirt,
ARVIRAGUS. I'll make't my comfort
ARVIRAGUS. Or I, whate'er it be,  
ARVIRAGUS. The night to th' owl and morn to th' lark less welcome.
ARVIRAGUS. I pray draw near.                            Exeunt

ARCHBISHOP. No, no, my lord. Note this: the King is weary
ARCHBISHOP. 'Tis very true;
ARCHBISHOP. Before, and greet his Grace. My lord, we come.
ARCHBISHOP. Good my Lord of Lancaster,
ARCHBISHOP. I take your princely word for these redresses.
ARCHBISHOP. To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.  
ARCHBISHOP. I do not doubt you.
ARCHBISHOP. Against ill chances men are ever merry;

ARTHUR. Alas, I then have chid away my friend!
ARTHUR. Is there no remedy?

ARTHUR. An if you do, you will but make it blush
ARTHUR. O, now you look like Hubert! All this while

ARMADO. It doth amount to one more than two.
ARMADO. True.
ARMADO. A most fine figure!
ARMADO. I will hereupon confess I am in love. And as it is base for
ARMADO. Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more;  
ARMADO. O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do excel thee
ARMADO. Of what complexion?
ARMADO. Tell me precisely of what complexion.
ARMADO. Is that one of the four complexions?
ARMADO. Green, indeed, is the colour of lovers; but to have a love
ARMADO. My love is most immaculate white and red.  
ARMADO. Define, define, well-educated infant.
ARMADO. Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty, and pathetical!
ARMADO. Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?
ARMADO. I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may
ARMADO. Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.
ARMADO. I say, sing.
ARMADO. I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!
ARMADO. I will visit thee at the lodge.
ARMADO. I know where it is situate.
ARMADO. I will tell thee wonders.
ARMADO. I love thee.
ARMADO. And so, farewell.
ARMADO. Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be
ARMADO. Thou shalt be heavily punished.
ARMADO. Take away this villain; shut him up.
ARMADO. I do affect the very ground, which is base, where her shoe,
ARMADO. Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.
ARMADO. Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years, take this key, give

ARMADO. But O- but O-
ARMADO. Call'st thou my love 'hobby-horse'?
ARMADO. Almost I had.
ARMADO. By heart and in heart, boy.
ARMADO. What wilt thou prove?
ARMADO. I am all these three.  
ARMADO. Fetch hither the swain; he must carry me a letter.
ARMADO. Ha, ha, what sayest thou?
ARMADO. The way is but short; away.
ARMADO. The meaning, pretty ingenious?
ARMADO. I say lead is slow.
ARMADO. Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
ARMADO. A most acute juvenal; volable and free of grace!  
ARMADO. Some enigma, some riddle; come, thy l'envoy; begin.
ARMADO. By virtue thou enforcest laughter; thy silly thought, my

ARMADO. But tell me: how was there a costard broken in a shin?
ARMADO. We will talk no more of this matter.
ARMADO. Sirrah Costard. I will enfranchise thee.
ARMADO. By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,

ARMADO. This Hector far surmounted Hannibal-
ARMADO. What meanest thou?
ARMADO. Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? Thou shalt die.
ARMADO. By the North Pole, I do challenge thee.
ARMADO. Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat in my  
ARMADO. Sweet bloods, I both may and will.
ARMADO. The naked truth of it is: I have no shirt; I go woolward
ARMADO. For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have seen the
ARMADO. Sweet Majesty, vouchsafe me-

ARCHIDAMUS. If the King had no son, they would desire to live on
ARVIRAGUS. Hail, heaven!
ARVIRAGUS. What should we speak of
ARVIRAGUS. I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.
ARVIRAGUS. All gold and silver rather turn to dirt,
ARVIRAGUS. I'll make't my comfort
ARVIRAGUS. Or I, whate'er it be,  
ARVIRAGUS. The night to th' owl and morn to th' lark less welcome.
ARVIRAGUS. I pray draw near.                            Exeunt

ARCHBISHOP. No, no, my lord. Note this: the King is weary
ARCHBISHOP. 'Tis very true;
ARCHBISHOP. Before, and greet his Grace. My lord, we come.
ARCHBISHOP. Good my Lord of Lancaster,
ARCHBISHOP. I take your princely word for these redresses.
ARCHBISHOP. To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.  
ARCHBISHOP. I do not doubt you.
ARCHBISHOP. Against ill chances men are ever merry;

ARTHUR. Alas, I then have chid away my friend!
ARTHUR. Is there no remedy?

ARTHUR. An if you do, you will but make it blush
ARTHUR. O, now you look like Hubert! All this while

ARMADO. It doth amount to one more than two.
ARMADO. True.
ARMADO. A most fine figure!
ARMADO. I will hereupon confess I am in love. And as it is base for
ARMADO. Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more;  
ARMADO. O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do excel thee
ARMADO. Of what complexion?
ARMADO. Tell me precisely of what complexion.
ARMADO. Is that one of the four complexions?
ARMADO. Green, indeed, is the colour of lovers; but to have a love
ARMADO. My love is most immaculate white and red.  
ARMADO. Define, define, well-educated infant.
ARMADO. Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty, and pathetical!
ARMADO. Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?
ARMADO. I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may
ARMADO. Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.
ARMADO. I say, sing.
ARMADO. I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!
ARMADO. I will visit thee at the lodge.
ARMADO. I know where it is situate.
ARMADO. I will tell thee wonders.
ARMADO. I love thee.
ARMADO. And so, farewell.
ARMADO. Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be
ARMADO. Thou shalt be heavily punished.
ARMADO. Take away this villain; shut him up.
ARMADO. I do affect the very ground, which is base, where her shoe,
ARMADO. Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.
ARMADO. Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years, take this key, give

ARMADO. But O- but O-
ARMADO. Call'st thou my love 'hobby-horse'?
ARMADO. Almost I had.
ARMADO. By heart and in heart, boy.
ARMADO. What wilt thou prove?
ARMADO. I am all these three.  
ARMADO. Fetch hither the swain; he must carry me a letter.
ARMADO. Ha, ha, what sayest thou?
ARMADO. The way is but short; away.
ARMADO. The meaning, pretty ingenious?
ARMADO. I say lead is slow.
ARMADO. Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
ARMADO. A most acute juvenal; volable and free of grace!  
ARMADO. Some enigma, some riddle; come, thy l'envoy; begin.
ARMADO. By virtue thou enforcest laughter; thy silly thought, my

ARMADO. But tell me: how was there a costard broken in a shin?
ARMADO. We will talk no more of this matter.
ARMADO. Sirrah Costard. I will enfranchise thee.
ARMADO. By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,

ARMADO. This Hector far surmounted Hannibal-
ARMADO. What meanest thou?
ARMADO. Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? Thou shalt die.
ARMADO. By the North Pole, I do challenge thee.
ARMADO. Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat in my  
ARMADO. Sweet bloods, I both may and will.
ARMADO. The naked truth of it is: I have no shirt; I go woolward
ARMADO. For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have seen the
ARMADO. Sweet Majesty, vouchsafe me-

ARCHIDAMUS. If the King had no son, they would desire to live on
ARVIRAGUS. Hail, heaven!
ARVIRAGUS. What should we speak of
ARVIRAGUS. I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.
ARVIRAGUS. All gold and silver rather turn to dirt,
ARVIRAGUS. I'll make't my comfort
ARVIRAGUS. Or I, whate'er it be,  
ARVIRAGUS. The night to th' owl and morn to th' lark less welcome.
ARVIRAGUS. I pray draw near.                            Exeunt

ARCHBISHOP. No, no, my lord. Note this: the King is weary
ARCHBISHOP. 'Tis very true;
ARCHBISHOP. Before, and greet his Grace. My lord, we come.
ARCHBISHOP. Good my Lord of Lancaster,
ARCHBISHOP. I take your princely word for these redresses.
ARCHBISHOP. To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.  
ARCHBISHOP. I do not doubt you.
ARCHBISHOP. Against ill chances men are ever merry;

ARTHUR. Alas, I then have chid away my friend!
ARTHUR. Is there no remedy?

ARTHUR. An if you do, you will but make it blush
ARTHUR. O, now you look like Hubert! All this while

ARMADO. It doth amount to one more than two.
ARMADO. True.
ARMADO. A most fine figure!
ARMADO. I will hereupon confess I am in love. And as it is base for
ARMADO. Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more;  
ARMADO. O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do excel thee
ARMADO. Of what complexion?
ARMADO. Tell me precisely of what complexion.
ARMADO. Is that one of the four complexions?
ARMADO. Green, indeed, is the colour of lovers; but to have a love
ARMADO. My love is most immaculate white and red.  
ARMADO. Define, define, well-educated infant.
ARMADO. Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty, and pathetical!
ARMADO. Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?
ARMADO. I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may
ARMADO. Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.
ARMADO. I say, sing.
ARMADO. I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!
ARMADO. I will visit thee at the lodge.
ARMADO. I know where it is situate.
ARMADO. I will tell thee wonders.
ARMADO. I love thee.
ARMADO. And so, farewell.
ARMADO. Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be
ARMADO. Thou shalt be heavily punished.
ARMADO. Take away this villain; shut him up.
ARMADO. I do affect the very ground, which is base, where her shoe,
ARMADO. Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.
ARMADO. Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years, take this key, give
ARMADO. How meanest thou? Brawling in French?
ARMADO. How hast thou purchased this experience?
ARMADO. But O- but O-
ARMADO. Call'st thou my love 'hobby-horse'?
ARMADO. Almost I had.
ARMADO. By heart and in heart, boy.
ARMADO. What wilt thou prove?
ARMADO. I am all these three.  
ARMADO. Fetch hither the swain; he must carry me a letter.
ARMADO. Ha, ha, what sayest thou?
ARMADO. The way is but short; away.
ARMADO. The meaning, pretty ingenious?
ARMADO. I say lead is slow.
ARMADO. Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
ARMADO. A most acute juvenal; volable and free of grace!  
ARMADO. Some enigma, some riddle; come, thy l'envoy; begin.
ARMADO. By virtue thou enforcest laughter; thy silly thought, my
ARMADO. No, page; it is an epilogue or discourse to make plain
ARMADO.  The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
ARMADO.  Until the goose came out of door,
ARMADO. Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?
ARMADO. But tell me: how was there a costard broken in a shin?
ARMADO. We will talk no more of this matter.
ARMADO. Sirrah Costard. I will enfranchise thee.
ARMADO. By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,
ARMADO. I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and, in  
ARMADO. [To MOTH] Chirrah!
ARMADO. Men of peace, well encount'red.
ARMADO. [To HOLOFERNES] Monsieur, are you not lett'red?
ARMADO. Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet touch,
ARMADO. Arts-man, preambulate; we will be singuled from the
ARMADO. At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.
ARMADO. Sir, it is the King's most sweet pleasure and affection to
ARMADO. Sir, the King is a noble gentleman, and my familiar, I do
ARMADO. Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for that
ARMADO. For the rest of the Worthies?
ARMADO. Shall I tell you a thing?
ARMADO. We will have, if this fadge not, an antic. I beseech you,
ARMADO. Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal sweet
ARMADO. That is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch; for, I
ARMADO. The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,
ARMADO. Peace!
ARMADO. Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.
ARMADO. The sweet war-man is dead and rotten; sweet chucks, beat
ARMADO. I do adore thy sweet Grace's slipper.
ARMADO. This Hector far surmounted Hannibal-
ARMADO. What meanest thou?
ARMADO. Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? Thou shalt die.
ARMADO. By the North Pole, I do challenge thee.
ARMADO. Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat in my  
ARMADO. Sweet bloods, I both may and will.
ARMADO. The naked truth of it is: I have no shirt; I go woolward
ARMADO. For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have seen the
ARMADO. Sweet Majesty, vouchsafe me-
ARMADO. I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am a

AUDREY. Your features! Lord warrant us! What features?
AUDREY. I do not know what 'poetical' is. Is it honest in deed and
AUDREY. Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?
AUDREY. Would you not have me honest?
AUDREY. Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make me
AUDREY. I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
AUDREY. Well, the gods give us joy!  
AUDREY. Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old
AUDREY. Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in the

AUDREY. Do, good William.
AUDREY. I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is no

AUFIDIUS. The town is ta'en.
AUFIDIUS. Condition!
AUFIDIUS. Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd
AUFIDIUS. I am attended at the cypress grove; I pray you-
AUFIDIUS. Where is this fellow?
AUFIDIUS. Whence com'st thou? What wouldst thou? Thy name?
AUFIDIUS. What is thy name?
AUFIDIUS. Say, what's thy name?
AUFIDIUS. I know thee not. Thy name?
AUFIDIUS. O Marcius, Marcius!
AUFIDIUS. Therefore, most. absolute sir, if thou wilt have  
AUFIDIUS. Do they still fly to th' Roman?
AUFIDIUS. I cannot help it now,
AUFIDIUS. I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
AUFIDIUS. All places yield to him ere he sits down,
AUFIDIUS. You keep a constant temper.
AUFIDIUS. Only their ends
AUFIDIUS. I was mov'd withal.
AUFIDIUS.  [Aside]  I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy

AUFIDIUS. Even so

AUFIDIUS. I know it;
AUFIDIUS. That I would have spoken of.
AUFIDIUS. There was it;
AUFIDIUS. Say no more:
AUFIDIUS. I have not deserv'd it.
AUFIDIUS. He approaches; you shall hear him.
AUFIDIUS. Read it not, noble lords;
AUFIDIUS. Ay, traitor, Marcius.
AUFIDIUS. Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius! Dost thou think

AUSTRIA. Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss
AUSTRIA. The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords  
AUSTRIA. By how much unexpected, by so much
AUSTRIA. Peace!
AUSTRIA. What the devil art thou?
AUSTRIA. What cracker is this same that deafs our ears
AUSTRIA. Peace! no more.
AUSTRIA. I from the north.
AUSTRIA. And your lips too; for I am well assur'd
AUSTRIA. Lady Constance, peace!
AUSTRIA. O that a man should speak those words to me!
AUSTRIA. Thou dar'st not say so, villain, for thy life.
AUSTRIA. King Philip, listen to the Cardinal.
AUSTRIA. Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs,
AUSTRIA. Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
AUSTRIA. Rebellion, flat rebellion!
AUMERLE. Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.
AUMERLE. Why then, the champions are prepar'd, and stay
AUMERLE. Cousin, farewell; what presence must not know,
AUMERLE. I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,
AUMERLE. Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,
AUMERLE. 'Farewell.'
AUMERLE, and soldiers
AUMERLE. Yea, my lord. How brooks your Grace the air
AUMERLE. He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
AUMERLE. Comfort, my liege, why looks your Grace so pale?
AUMERLE. Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.
AUMERLE. Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?
AUMERLE. Where is the Duke my father with his power?
AUMERLE. My father hath a power; inquire of him,
AUMERLE. My liege, one word.
AUMERLE, SCROOP, and SALISBURY
AUMERLE. No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
AUMERLE. Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.
AUMERLE. Princes, and noble lords,

AUMERLE. Thou dar'st not, coward, live to see that day.
AUMERLE. Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.
AUMERLE. An if I do not, may my hands rot of

AUMERLE. Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
AUMERLE. You holy clergymen, is there no plot
AUMERLE. Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not.
AUMERLE. For aught I know, my lord, they do.
AUMERLE. If God prevent not, I purpose so.
AUMERLE. My lord, 'tis nothing.
AUMERLE. I do beseech your Grace to pardon me;
AUMERLE. I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.  
AUMERLE. Good mother, be content; it is no more
AUMERLE. Where is the King?
AUMERLE. God save your Grace! I do beseech your Majesty,
AUMERLE. For ever may my knees grow to the earth,
AUMERLE. Then give me leave that I may turn the key,
AUMERLE. Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.
AUMERLE. Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd.

AUTOLYCUS. A footman, sweet sir, a footman.
AUTOLYCUS. O, good sir, tenderly, O!
AUTOLYCUS. O, good sir, softly, good sir; I fear, sir, my shoulder
AUTOLYCUS. Softly, dear sir  [Picks his pocket];  good sir, softly.
AUTOLYCUS. No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir. I have a
AUTOLYCUS. A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with
AUTOLYCUS. Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well; he hath
AUTOLYCUS. Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that put
AUTOLYCUS. I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter; I am false

AUTOLYCUS. No, good-fac'd sir; no, sweet sir.
AUTOLYCUS. Prosper you, sweet sir!                  Exit CLOWN
AUTOLYCUS. And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad; therefore it

AUTOLYCUS. Here's one to a very doleful tune: how a usurer's wife
AUTOLYCUS. Very true, and but a month old.
AUTOLYCUS. Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress Taleporter,
AUTOLYCUS. Here's another ballad, of a fish that appeared upon the
AUTOLYCUS. Five justices' hands at it; and witnesses more than my
AUTOLYCUS. This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.
AUTOLYCUS. Why, this is a passing merry one, and goes to the tune
AUTOLYCUS. I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my occupation.
AUTOLYCUS. Get you hence, for I must go

AUTOLYCUS. Neither.

AUTOLYCUS. Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest thou

AUTOLYCUS. How blessed are we that are not simple men!
AUTOLYCUS. The fardel there? What's i' th' fardel? Wherefore that
AUTOLYCUS. Age, thou hast lost thy labour.
AUTOLYCUS. The King is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a new
AUTOLYCUS. If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly; the
AUTOLYCUS. Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and  
AUTOLYCUS. He has a son- who shall be flay'd alive; then 'nointed

AUTOLYCUS. Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this
AUTOLYCUS. O, that's the case of the shepherd's son! Hang him,
AUTOLYCUS. I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side; go on
AUTOLYCUS. If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would not

AUTOLYCUS. I would most gladly know the issue of it.
AUTOLYCUS. Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me, would

AUFIDIUS. I know it;
AUFIDIUS. That I would have spoken of.
AUFIDIUS. There was it;
AUFIDIUS. Say no more:
AUFIDIUS. I have not deserv'd it.
AUFIDIUS. He approaches; you shall hear him.
AUFIDIUS. Read it not, noble lords;
AUFIDIUS. Ay, traitor, Marcius.
AUFIDIUS. Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius! Dost thou think  
AUFIDIUS. Name not the god, thou boy of tears-
AUFIDIUS. -no more.
AUFIDIUS. Why, noble lords,
AUFIDIUS. Insolent villain!
AUFIDIUS stands on him]
AUFIDIUS. My noble masters, hear me speak.
AUFIDIUS. My lords, when you shall know- as in this rage,
AUFIDIUS. My rage is gone,
AUVERGNE. The Castle
AUSTRIA. Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss
AUSTRIA. The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords  
AUSTRIA. By how much unexpected, by so much
AUSTRIA. Peace!
AUSTRIA. What the devil art thou?
AUSTRIA. What cracker is this same that deafs our ears
AUSTRIA. Peace! no more.
AUSTRIA. I from the north.
AUSTRIA. And your lips too; for I am well assur'd
AUSTRIA. Lady Constance, peace!
AUSTRIA. O that a man should speak those words to me!
AUSTRIA. Thou dar'st not say so, villain, for thy life.
AUSTRIA. King Philip, listen to the Cardinal.
AUSTRIA. Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs,
AUSTRIA. Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
AUSTRIA. Rebellion, flat rebellion!
AUMERLE. Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.
AUMERLE. Why then, the champions are prepar'd, and stay
AUMERLE. Cousin, farewell; what presence must not know,
AUMERLE. I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,
AUMERLE. Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,
AUMERLE. 'Farewell.'
AUMERLE, and soldiers
AUMERLE. Yea, my lord. How brooks your Grace the air
AUMERLE. He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
AUMERLE. Comfort, my liege, why looks your Grace so pale?
AUMERLE. Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.
AUMERLE. Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?
AUMERLE. Where is the Duke my father with his power?
AUMERLE. My father hath a power; inquire of him,
AUMERLE. My liege, one word.
AUMERLE, SCROOP, and SALISBURY
AUMERLE. No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
AUMERLE. Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.
AUMERLE. Princes, and noble lords,
AUMERLE. Excepting one, I would he were the best
AUMERLE. Thou dar'st not, coward, live to see that day.
AUMERLE. Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.
AUMERLE. An if I do not, may my hands rot of
AUMERLE. Who sets me else? By heaven, I'll throw at all!
AUMERLE. Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
AUMERLE. You holy clergymen, is there no plot
AUMERLE. Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not.
AUMERLE. For aught I know, my lord, they do.
AUMERLE. If God prevent not, I purpose so.
AUMERLE. My lord, 'tis nothing.
AUMERLE. I do beseech your Grace to pardon me;
AUMERLE. I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.  
AUMERLE. Good mother, be content; it is no more
AUMERLE. Where is the King?
AUMERLE. God save your Grace! I do beseech your Majesty,
AUMERLE. For ever may my knees grow to the earth,
AUMERLE. Then give me leave that I may turn the key,
AUMERLE. Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.
AUMERLE. Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd.

AUTOLYCUS. A footman, sweet sir, a footman.
AUTOLYCUS. O, good sir, tenderly, O!

AUTOLYCUS. Softly, dear sir  [Picks his pocket];  good sir, softly.
AUTOLYCUS. No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir. I have a
AUTOLYCUS. A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with
AUTOLYCUS. Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well; he hath
AUTOLYCUS. Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that put
AUTOLYCUS. I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter; I am false
AUTOLYCUS. Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and walk.
AUTOLYCUS. No, good-fac'd sir; no, sweet sir.
AUTOLYCUS. Prosper you, sweet sir!                  Exit CLOWN
AUTOLYCUS. And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad; therefore it
AUTOLYCUS. I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of
AUTOLYCUS. Here's one to a very doleful tune: how a usurer's wife
AUTOLYCUS. Very true, and but a month old.
AUTOLYCUS. Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress Taleporter,
AUTOLYCUS. Here's another ballad, of a fish that appeared upon the
AUTOLYCUS. Five justices' hands at it; and witnesses more than my
AUTOLYCUS. This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.
AUTOLYCUS. Why, this is a passing merry one, and goes to the tune
AUTOLYCUS. I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my occupation.
AUTOLYCUS. Get you hence, for I must go

AUTOLYCUS. Neither.
AUTOLYCUS. And you shall pay well for 'em.
AUTOLYCUS. Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his sworn

AUTOLYCUS. I am a poor fellow, sir.  [Aside]  I know ye well

AUTOLYCUS. Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest thou

AUTOLYCUS. How blessed are we that are not simple men!
AUTOLYCUS. The fardel there? What's i' th' fardel? Wherefore that
AUTOLYCUS. Age, thou hast lost thy labour.
AUTOLYCUS. The King is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a new
AUTOLYCUS. If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly; the
AUTOLYCUS. Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and  
AUTOLYCUS. He has a son- who shall be flay'd alive; then 'nointed

AUTOLYCUS. Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this
AUTOLYCUS. O, that's the case of the shepherd's son! Hang him,
AUTOLYCUS. I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side; go on
AUTOLYCUS. If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would not

AUTOLYCUS. I would most gladly know the issue of it.
AUTOLYCUS. Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me, would

AUTOLYCUS. I will prove so, sir, to my power.
AUDREY, a country wench
AUDREY. Your features! Lord warrant us! What features?
AUDREY. I do not know what 'poetical' is. Is it honest in deed and
AUDREY. Do you wish, then, that the gods had made me poetical?
AUDREY. Would you not have me honest?
AUDREY. Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make me
AUDREY. I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
AUDREY. Well, the gods give us joy!  
AUDREY. Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old
AUDREY. Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in the

AUDREY, a country wench
AUDREY. Your features! Lord warrant us! What features?
AUDREY. I do not know what 'poetical' is. Is it honest in deed and

AUDREY. Would you not have me honest?
AUDREY. Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods make me

AUDREY. Well, the gods give us joy!  
AUDREY. Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old

AUSTRIA. By how much unexpected, by so much
AUSTRIA. Peace!
AUSTRIA. What the devil art thou?
AUSTRIA. What cracker is this same that deafs our ears
AUSTRIA. Peace! no more.
AUSTRIA. I from the north.
AUSTRIA. And your lips too; for I am well assur'd
AUSTRIA. Lady Constance, peace!
AUSTRIA. O that a man should speak those words to me!
AUSTRIA. Thou dar'st not say so, villain, for thy life.
AUSTRIA. King Philip, listen to the Cardinal.
AUSTRIA. Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs,
AUSTRIA. Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
AUSTRIA. Rebellion, flat rebellion!
AUMERLE. Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.
AUMERLE. Why then, the champions are prepar'd, and stay
AUMERLE. Cousin, farewell; what presence must not know,

AUMERLE. Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.
AUMERLE. Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?
AUMERLE. Where is the Duke my father with his power?
AUMERLE. My father hath a power; inquire of him,
AUMERLE. My liege, one word.
AUMERLE, SCROOP, and SALISBURY
AUMERLE. No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
AUMERLE. Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.
AUMERLE. Princes, and noble lords,
AUMERLE. Excepting one, I would he were the best
AUMERLE. Thou dar'st not, coward, live to see that day.
AUMERLE. Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.

AUMERLE. Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
AUMERLE. You holy clergymen, is there no plot
AUMERLE. Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not.
AUMERLE. For aught I know, my lord, they do.
AUMERLE. If God prevent not, I purpose so.
AUMERLE. My lord, 'tis nothing.
AUMERLE. I do beseech your Grace to pardon me;

Achilles; Achilles is my lord; I am Patroclus' knower; and
Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon; Thersites is a
Achilles.  
Achilles bids you welcome.
Achilles Is arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance.
According to my birth. What do you say?
According to my shallow simple skill.
According to our proclamation, gone?
According to your ladyship's impose,
Account me not your servant.
Acquaint the Queen of your most noble offer
Accomplished in himself, not in his case,
Accuse me thus, that I have scanted all,
Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
According to the measure of their states.
According to the statute of the town,
Action is eloquence, and the eyes of th' ignorant
Accept my thankfulness.
According to the honour of his sender;
Accessible is none but Milford way.                   Exeunt
Accommodated by the place, more charming
Accuse the Thunderer whose bolt, you know,
Act II. Scene I.
According to the phrase or the addition
Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
According to our threefold order ta'en?
Accompany the greatness of thy blood  
Acquitted by a true substantial form,
Accusing it, I put it on my head,
Acting that argument. And now my death
According to the weight and worthiness.
According to their firm proposed natures.
Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
According to that state you shall be us'd.
According as I gave directions?
Accords not with the sadness of my suit.
Acquainted with this stranger; 'tis as like you
Acquainted me with interest to this land,
Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
According to the which thou shalt discourse
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
According to my bond; no more nor less.
Action and accent did they teach him there:
According to the gift which bounteous nature
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,
Accounted dangerous folly. Why then, alas,
Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
Admit impediments, love is not love
Advise him.
Adoption strives with nature, and choice breeds
Adieu till then; then fail not. You have won
Admir'd Octavia. Great Mark Antony
Adore our errors, laugh at's while we strut
Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,
Adieu, good Queen; I must attend on Caesar.
Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,
Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.                      Exit.  
Addicted so and so'; and there put on him
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
Advantage feeds him fat while men delay.            Exeunt.
Adam fell; and what should poor Jack Falstaff do in the days of
Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!
Added to that that am to deliver!

Adorn his temples with a coronet
Adventure to be banished myself;

Affairs of Antony; there did dissuade
After my flight. Now go we in content
After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
After the shepherd that complain'd of love,
Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;
After some question with him, was converted
After his brother, and importun'd me
After you first forswore it on the mart;
After so long grief, such nativity!
After the inveterate hate he bears you.
After your way his tale pronounc'd shall bury
After the slander of most stepmothers,
After long absence, such is yours. Most welcome!
After your will, have cross'd the sea, attending
Affected greatness got by you, not you;
Affront Ophelia.  
After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
After the thing it loves.
Afford no extraordinary gaze,
After th' admired heels of Bolingbroke,
After this cold considerance, sentence me;
After my seeming. The tide of blood in me
After defunction of King Pharamond,
After the taste of much correction.
After your thoughts, straight back again to France.     Exit
After this golden day of victory. Flourish.           Exeunt
After that things are set in order here,
After some respite will return to Calais;
After the slaughter of so many peers,
After the BEADLE hath hit him once, he leaps over
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,
After the hideous storm that follow'd, was
After your Highness had reprov'd the Duke
Affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty;  
After his patient's death: the King already
After they heard young Arthur was alive?
After young Arthur, claim this land for mine;
After such bloody toil, we bid good night;
After my speech is ended.
Affliction till it do cry out itself
After these ways; so, it will make us mad.
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well.
After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
After him, fellows; bring him to the block.
After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.
After your own sense, yea, though our proper son
After some time, to abuse Othello's ear
After new fancies. She dying gave it me,
After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,
After our sentence plaining comes too late.
After your late tossing on the breaking seas?
After a well-grac'd actor leaves the stage
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
After the battle let George Stanley die.
After the prompter, for our entrance;
Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,
Afore me, It is so very very late
Affection is not rated from the heart;
Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
After his studies or his usual pain?
After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel,
After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
After summer merrily.
After distasteful looks, and these hard fractions,
After the General, I beseech you next
After we part from Agamemnon's tent,
After the last enchantment you did here,
After your dire-lamenting elegies,
Affection! thy intention stabs the centre.
Affliction alters.
Affront his eye.
Afresh within me; and these thy offices,
After a thousand victories once foiled,
After my death (dear love) forget me quite,
After well-ent'red soldiers, to return
After he scores, he never pays the score.

Affection is not rated from the heart;
Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
After his studies or his usual pain?
After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel,
After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
After summer merrily.
After distasteful looks, and these hard fractions,
After the General, I beseech you next
After we part from Agamemnon's tent,
After the last enchantment you did here,
After your dire-lamenting elegies,
Affection! thy intention stabs the centre.
Affliction alters.
Affront his eye.
Afresh within me; and these thy offices,
After a thousand victories once foiled,
After my death (dear love) forget me quite,
After well-ent'red soldiers, to return
After he scores, he never pays the score.
Affairs of Antony; there did dissuade
After my flight. Now go we in content
After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
After the shepherd that complain'd of love,
Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;
After some question with him, was converted
After his brother, and importun'd me
After you first forswore it on the mart;
After so long grief, such nativity!
After the inveterate hate he bears you.
After your way his tale pronounc'd shall bury
After the slander of most stepmothers,
After long absence, such is yours. Most welcome!
After your will, have cross'd the sea, attending
Affected greatness got by you, not you;
Affront Ophelia.  
After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
After the thing it loves.
Afford no extraordinary gaze,
After th' admired heels of Bolingbroke,
After this cold considerance, sentence me;
After my seeming. The tide of blood in me
After defunction of King Pharamond,
After the taste of much correction.
After your thoughts, straight back again to France.     Exit
After this golden day of victory. Flourish.           Exeunt
After that things are set in order here,
After some respite will return to Calais;
After the slaughter of so many peers,
After the BEADLE hath hit him once, he leaps over
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,
After the hideous storm that follow'd, was
After your Highness had reprov'd the Duke
Affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty;  
After his patient's death: the King already
After they heard young Arthur was alive?
After young Arthur, claim this land for mine;
After such bloody toil, we bid good night;
After my speech is ended.
Affliction till it do cry out itself
After these ways; so, it will make us mad.
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well.
After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
After him, fellows; bring him to the block.
After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.
After your own sense, yea, though our proper son
After some time, to abuse Othello's ear
After new fancies. She dying gave it me,
After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,
After our sentence plaining comes too late.
After your late tossing on the breaking seas?
After a well-grac'd actor leaves the stage
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
After the battle let George Stanley die.
After the prompter, for our entrance;
Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,
Afore me, It is so very very late

All men make faults, and even I in this,

All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:
Although thou steal thee all my poverty:
All days are nights to see till I see thee,
All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that due,
Although in me each part will be forgotten.
All these I better in one general best.

Alack what poverty my muse brings forth,
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
Alas 'tis true, I have gone here and there,
Alas why fearing of time's tyranny,
All men are bad and in their badness reign.
All this the world well knows yet none knows well,  
Although I swear it to my self alone.
Although she knows my days are past the best,
All but new things disdain; whose judgments are

Aloof from th' entire point. Will you have her?
All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.
Alb. Pray, sir, be patient.
Alb. My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant
Alb. Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?
Alb. What's the matter, sir?
Alb. I cannot be so partial, Goneril,
Alb. Well, you may fear too far.
Alb. How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell.
Alb. Well, well; th' event.                            Exeunt.
All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not scape;
All the stor'd vengeances of heaven fall
Allow obedience- if yourselves are old,

Allow not nature more than nature needs,
All cruels else subscrib'd. But I shall see
Allows itself to anything.
Alb. O Goneril,
Alb. Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;
Alb. See thyself, devil!
Alb. Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame!  
Alb. What news?
Alb. Gloucester's eyes?
Alb. This shows you are above,
Alb. Where was his son when they did take his eyes?
Alb. He is not here.

Alb. Gloucester, I live
Along with me.                                      Exeunt.
All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,
All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,
Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge
All my reports go with the modest truth;

Alb. Let's then determine
Alb. I'll overtake you.- Speak.
Alb. Stay till I have read the letter.

Alb. Thou art arm'd, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound.
Alb. A herald, ho!
Alb. Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,
All levied in my name, have in my name
Alb. She is not well. Convey her to my tent.
Alb. Ask him his purposes, why he appears

Alb. Methought thy very gait did prophesy
Alb. Where have you hid yourself?
Alb. If there be more, more woful, hold it in;
Alb. But who was this?
Alb. Speak, man.  
Alb. Who dead? Speak, man.
Alb. Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead.
Alb. Great thing of us forgot!
Alb. Even so. Cover their faces.
Alb. Run, run, O, run!
Alb. Haste thee for thy life.                    [Exit Edgar.]
Alb. The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.
Alb. Fall and cease!
Alb. He knows not what he says; and vain is it
Alb. That's but a trifle here.
Alb. Bear them from hence. Our present business
Alb. The weight of this sad time we must obey,
Although not valued to the money's worth.

All losses are restored, and sorrows end.
All men make faults, and even I in this,
Although our undivided loves are one:
All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:

All these I better in one general best.
All this away, and me most wretchcd make.
Alack what poverty my muse brings forth,
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
Alas 'tis true, I have gone here and there,
Alas why fearing of time's tyranny,
All men are bad and in their badness reign.
All this the world well knows yet none knows well,

Aloof from th' entire point. Will you have her?
All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.
Alb. Pray, sir, be patient.
Alb. My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant
Alb. Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?
Alb. What's the matter, sir?
Alb. I cannot be so partial, Goneril,
Alb. Well, you may fear too far.
Alb. How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell.
Alb. Well, well; th' event.                            Exeunt.
All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not scape;

Alb. What news?

Along with me.                                      Exeunt.
All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,

Alb. The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.
Alb. Fall and cease!
Alb. He knows not what he says; and vain is it
Alb. That's but a trifle here.
Alb. Bear them from hence. Our present business
Alb. The weight of this sad time we must obey,
Although not valued to the money's worth.
All liberal reason I will yield unto.
All senses to that sense did make their repair,
All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;
All unseen, can passage find;  
All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?
Alexander; Arinado's page, Hercules; the pedant, Judas
Alexander.
Alisander- alas! you see how 'tis- a little o'erparted. But there
All causes to the purpose of his speed;
All wanton as a child, skipping and vain;
All the quarters that they know
All that impedes thee from the golden round,
Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
All is but toys; renown and grace is dead,
All by the name of dogs. The valued file
Already are i' the court.
All causes shall give way. I am in blood
All which we pine for now. And this report
All is the fear and nothing is the love;

All continent impediments would o'erbear
All unity on earth.
Already at a point, was setting forth.

All in an hour.
Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.
Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth
All the power this charm doth owe:
Alack, where are you? Speak, an if you hear;
All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,
All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?  
Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.
Already to their wormy beds are gone,
All with weary task fordone.
All prompting me how fair young Hero is,
All matter else seems weak. She cannot love,
Always excepted my dear Claudio.
All you that see her, that she were a maid
Almost the copy of my child that's dead,
Although against her will, as it appears
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
All my abilities in thy behalf.
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! My lord!
All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head,
Alas, my friend and my dear countryman
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?
All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.
Albeit unused to the melting mood,
Alack, and what shall good old York there see
Alas, I look'd when some of you should say
All these, well furnish'd by the Duke of Britaine,  
All souls that will be safe, fly from my side;
All murder'd-for within the hollow crown
Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
All must be even in our government.
Although apparent guilt be seen in them;
All pomp and majesty I do forswear;
Aldermen, Citizens, Soldiers, Messengers, Murderers, Keeper
Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal,
All scatt'red in the bottom of the sea;
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath  
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes
Alas, I am the mother of these griefs!
Alas, you three on me, threefold distress'd,
All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
All circumstances well considered.
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
Albeit they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
Alack, I love myself. Wherefore? For any good
All several sins, all us'd in each degree,

Alarums. Enter KING RICHARD
Alarum. Enter RICHARD and RICHMOND; they fight; RICHARD is slain.
All this divided York and Lancaster,
Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;

Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
All our whole city is much bound to him.
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!
Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains  
All this I know, and to the marriage
Although I think 'twas in another sense-
All books of love, see that at any hand;
All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
Allots thee for his lovely bed-fellow.
All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd
Allaying both their fury and my passion
All points of my command.

Although they want the use of tongue, a kind
Although my last; no matter, since I feel
All sanctimonious ceremonies may

All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-fac'd flatterer
All those which were his fellows but of late-
All of companionship.
All use of quittance.
All that pass by. It cannot hold; no reason
All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!
Although I know you'll swear, terribly swear,
All that you meet are thieves. To Athens go,
All I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.
Allow'd with absolute power, and thy good name
Alive and dead; and for their brethren slain
Alarbus goes to rest, and we survive
All on a heap, like to a slaughtered lamb,
Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,
Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.

Alb. That's but a trifle here.
Alb. Bear them from hence. Our present business

Although not valued to the money's worth.
All liberal reason I will yield unto.
All senses to that sense did make their repair,
All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;
All unseen, can passage find;  
All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?

All that impedes thee from the golden round,
Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
All is but toys; renown and grace is dead,
All by the name of dogs. The valued file
Already are i' the court.
All causes shall give way. I am in blood

Alack, where are you? Speak, an if you hear;
All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,
All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?  
Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.
Already to their wormy beds are gone,
All with weary task fordone.
All prompting me how fair young Hero is,
All matter else seems weak. She cannot love,
Always excepted my dear Claudio.
All you that see her, that she were a maid
Almost the copy of my child that's dead,
Although against her will, as it appears
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
All my abilities in thy behalf.

All murder'd-for within the hollow crown
Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
All must be even in our government.

All pomp and majesty I do forswear;
Aldermen, Citizens, Soldiers, Messengers, Murderers, Keeper
Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal,
All scatt'red in the bottom of the sea;
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath  
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes
Alas, I am the mother of these griefs!
Alas, you three on me, threefold distress'd,
All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
All circumstances well considered.
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.

Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
All our whole city is much bound to him.
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!
Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains  
All this I know, and to the marriage
Although I think 'twas in another sense-
All books of love, see that at any hand;
All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
Allots thee for his lovely bed-fellow.

All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-fac'd flatterer
All those which were his fellows but of late-
All of companionship.
All use of quittance.
All that pass by. It cannot hold; no reason
All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!
Although I know you'll swear, terribly swear,
All that you meet are thieves. To Athens go,
All I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.
Allow'd with absolute power, and thy good name
Alive and dead; and for their brethren slain
Alarbus goes to rest, and we survive
All on a heap, like to a slaughtered lamb,
Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,
Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.

Alas the day, how loath you are to offend daylight! An 'twere
All the commerce that you have had with Troy
All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips
Alas, a kind of godly jealousy,
All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood
Along the field I will the Troyan trail.                   Exeunt

Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!
Alas, their love may be call'd appetite-
Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel

All this I speak in print, for in print I found it. Why muse you,
Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.          Exeunt
All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,
Alas, poor Proteus, thou hast entertain'd
Alas, poor fool, why do I pity him
Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!
Alas, how love can trifle with itself!
All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.
All in Bohemia's well- this satisfaction
Almost as like as eggs. Women say so,
All that are his so too. To do this deed,
Alack, for lesser knowledge! How accurs'd
All's true that is mistrusted. That false villain
Although the print be little, the whole matter
All tongues to talk their bitt'rest.
All faults I make, when I shall come to know them.
All that you speak shows fair.
All mine own folly- the society,
All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,
All kind of arguments and question deep,
All replication prompt, and reason strong,
All vows and consecrations giving place,
All melting; though our drops this diff'rence bore:
All losses are restored, and sorrows end.
All men make faults, and even I in this,
Although our undivided loves are one:
All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:
Although thou steal thee all my poverty:
All days are nights to see till I see thee,
All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that due,
Although in me each part will be forgotten.
All these I better in one general best.
All this away, and me most wretchcd make.
Alack what poverty my muse brings forth,
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
Alas 'tis true, I have gone here and there,
Alas why fearing of time's tyranny,
All men are bad and in their badness reign.
All this the world well knows yet none knows well,  
Although I swear it to my self alone.
Although she knows my days are past the best,
All but new things disdain; whose judgments are

Already at my house.

Already are i' the court.

Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
All our whole city is much bound to him.
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!
Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains

All of companionship.
All use of quittance.
All that pass by. It cannot hold; no reason
All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!
Although I know you'll swear, terribly swear,
All that you meet are thieves. To Athens go,
All I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.
Allow'd with absolute power, and thy good name
Alive and dead; and for their brethren slain
Alarbus goes to rest, and we survive
All on a heap, like to a slaughtered lamb,

Alas the day, how loath you are to offend daylight! An 'twere
All the commerce that you have had with Troy
All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips
Alas, a kind of godly jealousy,

Alas, poor fool, why do I pity him
Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!
Alas, how love can trifle with itself!

All in Bohemia's well- this satisfaction
Almost as like as eggs. Women say so,
All that are his so too. To do this deed,
Alack, for lesser knowledge! How accurs'd
All's true that is mistrusted. That false villain
Although the print be little, the whole matter

All faults I make, when I shall come to know them.
All that you speak shows fair.
All mine own folly- the society,
All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,
All kind of arguments and question deep,
All replication prompt, and reason strong,
All vows and consecrations giving place,
All melting; though our drops this diff'rence bore:
All losses are restored, and sorrows end.
All men make faults, and even I in this,
Although our undivided loves are one:
All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:
Although thou steal thee all my poverty:
All days are nights to see till I see thee,
All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that due,
Although in me each part will be forgotten.
All these I better in one general best.
All this away, and me most wretchcd make.
Alack what poverty my muse brings forth,
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
Alas 'tis true, I have gone here and there,
Alas why fearing of time's tyranny,
All men are bad and in their badness reign.
All this the world well knows yet none knows well,  
Although I swear it to my self alone.
Although she knows my days are past the best,

Alb. My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant
Alb. Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?
Alb. What's the matter, sir?
Alb. I cannot be so partial, Goneril,
Alb. Well, you may fear too far.

Alb. That's but a trifle here.
Alb. Bear them from hence. Our present business
Alb. The weight of this sad time we must obey,
Although not valued to the money's worth.
All liberal reason I will yield unto.
All senses to that sense did make their repair,
All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;
All unseen, can passage find;  
All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?

Alexander.
Alisander- alas! you see how 'tis- a little o'erparted. But there
All causes to the purpose of his speed;

All that impedes thee from the golden round,
Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
All is but toys; renown and grace is dead,
All by the name of dogs. The valued file
Already are i' the court.

Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth
All the power this charm doth owe:
Alack, where are you? Speak, an if you hear;
All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,
All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?  
Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.
Already to their wormy beds are gone,
All with weary task fordone.
All prompting me how fair young Hero is,
All matter else seems weak. She cannot love,
Always excepted my dear Claudio.
All you that see her, that she were a maid
Almost the copy of my child that's dead,
Although against her will, as it appears
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
All my abilities in thy behalf.
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! My lord!

Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?
All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.

Alas, I look'd when some of you should say
All these, well furnish'd by the Duke of Britaine,  
All souls that will be safe, fly from my side;
All murder'd-for within the hollow crown
Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
All must be even in our government.

All pomp and majesty I do forswear;
Aldermen, Citizens, Soldiers, Messengers, Murderers, Keeper
Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal,
All scatt'red in the bottom of the sea;
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath  
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes
Alas, I am the mother of these griefs!
Alas, you three on me, threefold distress'd,
All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
All circumstances well considered.
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
Albeit they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
Alack, I love myself. Wherefore? For any good

Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
All our whole city is much bound to him.
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!
Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains  
All this I know, and to the marriage
Although I think 'twas in another sense-
All books of love, see that at any hand;

All liberal reason I will yield unto.
All senses to that sense did make their repair,
All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;

All that impedes thee from the golden round,
Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
All is but toys; renown and grace is dead,
All by the name of dogs. The valued file
Already are i' the court.
All causes shall give way. I am in blood

Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth
All the power this charm doth owe:
Alack, where are you? Speak, an if you hear;
All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,
All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?  
Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.
Already to their wormy beds are gone,
All with weary task fordone.
All prompting me how fair young Hero is,
All matter else seems weak. She cannot love,
Always excepted my dear Claudio.

Although against her will, as it appears
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
All my abilities in thy behalf.

All murder'd-for within the hollow crown
Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
All must be even in our government.

All pomp and majesty I do forswear;
Aldermen, Citizens, Soldiers, Messengers, Murderers, Keeper
Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal,
All scatt'red in the bottom of the sea;
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath  
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes
Alas, I am the mother of these griefs!
Alas, you three on me, threefold distress'd,
All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
All circumstances well considered.
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
Albeit they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,

Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
All our whole city is much bound to him.
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!
Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains  
All this I know, and to the marriage
Although I think 'twas in another sense-
All books of love, see that at any hand;
All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
Allots thee for his lovely bed-fellow.
All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd
Allaying both their fury and my passion
All points of my command.

Although my last; no matter, since I feel
All sanctimonious ceremonies may

All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-fac'd flatterer
All those which were his fellows but of late-
All of companionship.
All use of quittance.
All that pass by. It cannot hold; no reason
All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!
Although I know you'll swear, terribly swear,
All that you meet are thieves. To Athens go,
All I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.
Allow'd with absolute power, and thy good name
Alive and dead; and for their brethren slain
Alarbus goes to rest, and we survive
All on a heap, like to a slaughtered lamb,
Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,
Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.

Alas the day, how loath you are to offend daylight! An 'twere
All the commerce that you have had with Troy
All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips
Alas, a kind of godly jealousy,
All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood
Along the field I will the Troyan trail.                   Exeunt
All, if you will, for I myself am best
Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!
Alas, their love may be call'd appetite-
Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
All his in dedication; for his sake,
All the occurrence of my fortune since
All this I speak in print, for in print I found it. Why muse you,
Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.          Exeunt
All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,
Alas, poor Proteus, thou hast entertain'd
Alas, poor fool, why do I pity him
Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!
Alas, how love can trifle with itself!
All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.
All in Bohemia's well- this satisfaction
Almost as like as eggs. Women say so,
All that are his so too. To do this deed,
Alack, for lesser knowledge! How accurs'd
All's true that is mistrusted. That false villain
Although the print be little, the whole matter
All tongues to talk their bitt'rest.
All faults I make, when I shall come to know them.
All that you speak shows fair.
All mine own folly- the society,
All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,
All kind of arguments and question deep,
All replication prompt, and reason strong,
All vows and consecrations giving place,
All melting; though our drops this diff'rence bore:
All losses are restored, and sorrows end.
All men make faults, and even I in this,
Although our undivided loves are one:
All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:
Although thou steal thee all my poverty:
All days are nights to see till I see thee,
All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that due,
Although in me each part will be forgotten.
All these I better in one general best.
All this away, and me most wretchcd make.
Alack what poverty my muse brings forth,
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
Alas 'tis true, I have gone here and there,
Alas why fearing of time's tyranny,
All men are bad and in their badness reign.
All this the world well knows yet none knows well,  
Although I swear it to my self alone.
Although she knows my days are past the best,
All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
All that is virtuous-save what thou dislik'st,
Already at my house.

All's not offence that indiscretion finds
Allow not nature more than nature needs,
All cruels else subscrib'd. But I shall see
Allows itself to anything.
Alb. O Goneril,
Alb. Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;
Alb. See thyself, devil!
Alb. Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame!  
Alb. What news?
Alb. Gloucester's eyes?
Alb. This shows you are above,
Alb. Where was his son when they did take his eyes?
Alb. He is not here.
Alb. Knows he the wickedness?
Alb. Gloucester, I live
Along with me.                                      Exeunt.
All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,
All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,
Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge
All my reports go with the modest truth;
Alb. Our very loving sister, well bemet.
Alb. Let's then determine
Alb. I'll overtake you.- Speak.
Alb. Stay till I have read the letter.
Alb. Why, fare thee well. I will o'erlook thy paper.
Alb. We will greet the time.                             Exit.
Alarum within. Enter, with Drum and Colours, the Powers of France
Alarum and retreat within. Enter Edgar,
Alb. Sir, you have show'd to-day your valiant strain,
Alb. Sir, by your patience,
Alb. The let-alone lies not in your good will.
Alb. Half-blooded fellow, yes.
Alb. Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee
Alb. Thou art arm'd, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound.
Alb. A herald, ho!
Alb. Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,
All levied in my name, have in my name
Alb. She is not well. Convey her to my tent.
Alb. Ask him his purposes, why he appears
Alb. Which is that adversary?
Alarums. Fight. [Edmund falls.]
Alb. Save him, save him!
Alb. Shut your mouth, dame,
Alb. Most monstrous!
Alb. Go after her. She's desperate; govern her.
Alb. Methought thy very gait did prophesy
Alb. Where have you hid yourself?
Alb. If there be more, more woful, hold it in;
Alb. But who was this?
Alb. Speak, man.  
Alb. Who dead? Speak, man.
Alb. Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead.
Alb. Great thing of us forgot!
Alb. Even so. Cover their faces.
Alb. Run, run, O, run!
Alb. Haste thee for thy life.                    [Exit Edgar.]
Alb. The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.
Alb. Fall and cease!
Alb. He knows not what he says; and vain is it
Alb. That's but a trifle here.
Alb. Bear them from hence. Our present business
Alb. The weight of this sad time we must obey,
Although not valued to the money's worth.
All liberal reason I will yield unto.
All senses to that sense did make their repair,
All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;
All unseen, can passage find;  
All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?
Alexander; Arinado's page, Hercules; the pedant, Judas
Alexander.
Alisander- alas! you see how 'tis- a little o'erparted. But there
All causes to the purpose of his speed;
All wanton as a child, skipping and vain;
All the quarters that they know
All that impedes thee from the golden round,
Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
All is but toys; renown and grace is dead,
All by the name of dogs. The valued file
Already are i' the court.
All causes shall give way. I am in blood
All which we pine for now. And this report
All is the fear and nothing is the love;
All the particulars of vice so grafted
All continent impediments would o'erbear
All unity on earth.
Already at a point, was setting forth.
All swol'n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
Almost afraid to know itself! It cannot
Among a number one is reckoned none.
Am of my self, all-tyrant, for thy sake?
Among nine bad if one be good,
Ambitious love hath so in me offended

Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
Am not I your Rosalind?  
Am better than thy dear self's better part.
Am I your man? Am I myself?

Amongst your cloven army.
Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,

Among th' Italian gentry, and to fight
Am something nearer.
Amongst the rar'st of good ones- sitting sadly  
Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd.
Among a mineral of metals base,
Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
Amongst a grove the very straightest plant;
Among my household? Why is Rumour here?
Amongst the soldiers this is muttered
Am sure I scar'd the Dauphin and his trull,
Among which terms he us'd his lavish tongue
Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,
Among the people gather up a tenth.
Am I a queen in title and in style,
Am I not witch'd like her? Or thou not false like him?

Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand;

Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.

Am I to put our Cassio in some action  
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
Am I; who ready here do stand in arms
Amongst much other talk that very time  
Am I both priest and clerk? Well then, amen.
Among this princely heap, if any here,
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Am I the master here, or you? Go to!
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
Am bold to show myself a forward guest
Am starv'd for meat, giddy for lack of sleep;
Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
Am I this patient log-man.
Amen. So fall to't.
Amazon, and all dance, men witb women, a lofty
Amen.                                                   Exit
Among the rout of nations, I will make thee
Amen.
Ambitiously for rule and empery,
Among the nettles at the elder-tree
Amongst the fair-fac'd breeders of our clime;
Amidst the other, whose med'cinable eye
Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt
Amphimacus and Thoas deadly hurt;
Am not I consanguineous? Am I not of her blood? Tilly-vally,
Among the infinite doings of the world,
Am heir to my affection.
Amity too, of your brave father, whom,
Among a number one is reckoned none.
Am of my self, all-tyrant, for thy sake?
Among nine bad if one be good,
Ambitious love hath so in me offended
Am I or that or this for what he'll utter
Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy,
Am not I your Rosalind?  
Am better than thy dear self's better part.
Am I your man? Am I myself?
Among my wife and her confederates,
Amongst your cloven army.
Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,
Among the bands-may drive us to a render
Among th' Italian gentry, and to fight
Am something nearer.
Amongst the rar'st of good ones- sitting sadly  
Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd.
Among a mineral of metals base,
Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
Amongst a grove the very straightest plant;
Among my household? Why is Rumour here?
Amongst the soldiers this is muttered
Am sure I scar'd the Dauphin and his trull,
Among which terms he us'd his lavish tongue
Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,
Among the people gather up a tenth.
Am I a queen in title and in style,
Am I not witch'd like her? Or thou not false like him?
Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,
Ambitious York did level at thy crown,
Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;
Am yet a courtier beggarly-nor could
Among my maids, full little, God knows, looking
Ambassador to the Emperor, you made bold
Am for his love and service so to him.
Am bound to under-bear.
Among the high tides in the calendar?
Among the thorns and dangers of this world.
Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,
Among which number, Cassius, be you one-
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand;
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
And being frank she lends to those are free:
And that unfair which fairly doth excel:
And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,
And kept unused the user so destroys it:  
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,
And threescore year would make the world away:
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,
And sable curls all silvered o'er with white:  
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
And die as fast as they see others grow,
And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
And your sweet semblance to some other give.
And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
And yet methinks I have astronomy,
And constant stars in them I read such art
And wear their brave state out of memory.
And all in war with Time for love of you,
And fortify your self in your decay
And many maiden gardens yet unset,
And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
And your true rights be termed a poet's rage,
And stretched metre of an antique song.
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
And often is his gold complexion dimmed,
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood,
And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,
And do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed Time
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:
And for a woman wert thou first created,
And by addition me of thee defeated,
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
And then believe me, my love is as fair,
And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
And perspective it is best painter's art.
And in themselves their pride lies buried,
And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:
And puts apparel on my tattered loving,
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
And each (though enemies to either's reign)
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
And look upon my self and curse my fate,
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,
And moan th' expense of many a vanished sight.
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,
And all those friends which I thought buried.
And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
And though they be outstripped by every pen,
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,
And from the forlorn world his visage hide
And make me travel forth without my cloak,
And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
And 'gainst my self a lawful plea commence:
And by a part of all thy glory live:
And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?
And our dear love lose name of single one,
And that thou teachest how to make one twain,
And yet love knows it is a greater grief
And when a woman woos, what woman's son,
And chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth,
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly,
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
And losing her, my friend hath found that loss,
And both for my sake lay on me this cross,
And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.
And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.
And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
And by their verdict is determined
And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.
And each doth good turns now unto the other,
And to the painted banquet bids my heart:
Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part.
And I am still with them, and they with thee.
And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,
And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,
And this my hand, against my self uprear,
And you but one, can every shadow lend:
And you in Grecian tires are painted new:  
And you in every blessed shape we know.
And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
And broils root out the work of masonry,
And patience tame to sufferance bide each check,
And Time that gave, doth now his gift confound.
And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.
And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand
And all my soul, and all my every part;
And for this sin there is no remedy,
And for my self mine own worth do define,
And all those beauties whereof now he's king
And they shall live, and he in them still green.
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage.
And the firm soil win of the watery main,
And needy nothing trimmed in jollity,
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
And strength by limping sway disabled
And art made tongue-tied by authority,
And folly (doctor-like) controlling skill,
And simple truth miscalled simplicity,
And captive good attending captain ill.
And with his presence grace impiety,
And lace it self with his society?  
And steal dead seeming of his living hue?
And proud of many, lives upon his gains?
And him as for a map doth Nature store,
And that in guess they measure by thy deeds,
And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
And mock you with me after I am gone.
And hang more praise upon deceased I,
And live no more to shame nor me, nor you.
And so should you, to love things nothing worth.
And that is this, and this with thee remains.
And for the peace of you I hold such strife
And by and by clean starved for a look,
And keep invention in a noted weed,
And you and love are still my argument:
And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.  
And found such fair assistance in my verse,
And under thee their poesy disperse.
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,
And given grace a double majesty.
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be.
And my sick muse doth give an other place.
And found it in thy cheek: he can afford
And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,
And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
And therefore art enforced to seek anew,
And do so love, yet when they have devised,
And their gross painting might be better used,
And therefore to your fair no painting set,
And therefore have I slept in your report,
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.
And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen,
And to the most of praise add something more,
And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,
And for that riches where is my deserving?
And so my patent back again is swerving.
And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn:
And I by this will be a gainer too,
And I will comment upon that offence,
And haply of our old acquaintance tell.  
And do not drop in for an after-loss:
And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
And having thee, of all men's pride I boast.
And life no longer than thy love will stay,
And husband nature's riches from expense,
And all things turns to fair, that eyes can see!
And yet this time removed was summer's time,
And thou away, the very birds are mute.
And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair,
And to his robbery had annexed thy breath,
And gives thy pen both skill and argument.
And make time's spoils despised everywhere.
And to be praised of ages yet to be.
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
And more, much more than in my verse can sit,
And in this change is my invention spent,
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme,
And for they looked but with divining eyes,
And the sad augurs mock their own presage,
And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
And made my self a motley to the view,
And worse essays proved thee my best of love.
And almost thence my nature is subdued
And that which governs me to go about,
And that your love taught it this alchemy?
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up,
And to his palate doth prepare the cup.
And given to time your own dear-purchased right,
And on just proof surmise, accumulate,
And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness,  
And brought to medicine a healthful state
And ruined love when it is built anew  
And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent.
And for that sorrow, which I then did feel,
And I a tyrant have no leisure taken
And soon to you, as you to me then tendered
And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed,
And rather make them born to our desire,  
And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
And her quietus is to render thee.
And beauty slandered with a bastard shame,
And situation with those dancing chips,
And in some perfumes is there more delight,
And yet by heaven I think my love as rare,
And to be sure that is not false I swear,
And thence this slander as I think proceeds.
And truly not the morning sun of heaven  
And suit thy pity like in every part.
And all they foul that thy complexion lack.
And my next self thou harder hast engrossed,
And yet thou wilt, for I being pent in thee,
And I my self am mortgaged to thy will,
And sue a friend, came debtor for my sake,
And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in over-plus,
And in my will no fair acceptance shine?
And in abundance addeth to his store,
And will thy soul knows is admitted there,
And then thou lov'st me for my name is Will.
And to this false plague are they now transferred.
And wherefore say not I that I am old?
And age in love, loves not to have years told.
And in our faults by lies we flattered be.
And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
And in my madness might speak ill of thee,
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving,
And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,
And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind.
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil:
And whether that my angel be turned fiend,
And taught it thus anew to greet:
And saved my life saying 'not you'.
And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
And death once dead, there's no more dying then.
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest,
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
And all my honest faith in thee is lost.
And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove,
And thither hied a sad distempered guest.
And so the general of hot desire,
And these great tears grace his remembrance more
And think to wed it, he is so above me.
And yet I know him a notorious liar,
And show what we alone must think, which never
And Florence is denied before he comes;
And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,
And gave this sentence then:
And put you in the catalogue of those
And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,
And manifest experience had collected  
And pray God's blessing into thy attempt.
And is enough for both.
And find your Grace in health.
And that at my bidding you could so stand up.
And ask'd thee mercy for't.  
And write to her a love-line.
And not be all day neither.                       Exit LAFEU
And of his old experience th' only darling,
And, hearing your high Majesty is touch'd
And what impossibility would slay
And well deserv'd. Not helping, death's my fee;
And urge her to a present answer back;
And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense
And writ as little beard.
And to imperial Love, that god most high,
And these breed honour. That is honour's scorn
And is not like the sire. Honours thrive
And tell her she is thine; to whom I promise
And be perform'd to-night. The solemn feast
And wherefore I am fled; write to the King
And pleasure drown the brim.
And make this haste as your own good proceeding,
And rather muse than ask why I entreat you;
And my appointments have in them a need
And more thirsts after.
And all the honours that can fly from us
And, after some dispatch in hand at court,
And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains.
And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?
And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?
And though I kill him not, I am the cause
And angels offic'd all. I will be gone,
And Fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,
And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
And brokes with all that can in such a suit
And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,
And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature;
And would not put my reputation now
And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
And lawful meaning in a lawful act;
And I shall lose my life for want of language.
And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on
And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,
And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,
And now you should be as your mother was
And mock us with our bareness.
And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
And I'll be bid by thee.
And on your finger in the night I'll put
Another ring, that what in time proceeds
And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this:
And answer 'Thanks.' I duly am inform'd
And by the leave of my good lord the King,
And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!
And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;  
And therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,
And aid me with that store of power you have
And I beseech your Majesty to make it
And watch'd the time to shoot.
And deeper than oblivion do we bury
And ev'ry hair that's on 't, Helen, that's dead,
And mak'st conjectural fears to come into me
And yet I know not- thou didst hate her deadly,
And she is dead; which nothing, but to close
And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,
And therefore know how far I may be pitied.
And both shall cease, without your remedy.  
And was a common gamester to the camp.
And boarded her i' th' wanton way of youth.
And I had that which any inferior might
And give me mine again.
And he shall surety me. But for this lord
And at that time he got his wife with child.
And now behold the meaning.
And, look you, here's your letter. This it says:
And are by me with child,' etc. This is done.
And is become the bellows and the fan
And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,
And fertile every wish, a million.
And get her leave to part. For not alone
And not a serpent's poison. Say our pleasure,
And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
And that which most with you should safe my going,
And give true evidence to his love, which stands
An honourable trial.
And I am all forgotten!
And all the gods go with you! Upon your sword
And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.
And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
And so rebel to judgment.
And it appears he is belov'd of those
And the ebb'd man, ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love,
And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
And shall become you well, to entreat your captain
And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,
And have my learning from some true reports
And make the wars alike against my stomach,
And then when poisoned hours had bound me up
And all great fears, which now import their dangers,
And sway our great designs!
And do invite you to my sister's view,
And what they undid did.
And made their bends adornings. At the helm
And made a gap in nature.
And for his ordinary pays his heart
And, having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,
And, breathless, pow'r breathe forth.
And in our sports my better cunning faints
And though I make this marriage for my peace,
And say 'Ah ha! Y'are caught.'
And make thy fortunes proud. The blow thou hadst
And I will boot thee with what gift beside
An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell
And be undone by 'em!                         Exit MESSENGER
And we shall talk before we fight.
And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
And am well studied for a liberal thanks
And seal'd between us.  
And I have heard Apollodorus carried-
And well am like to do, for I perceive
And shortly comes to harvest.
And hear me speak a word.
And though you think me poor, I am the man
And when we are put off, fall to their throats.
And not have spoke on't. In me 'tis villainy:
And it grows fouler.
And celebrate our drink?
Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.
And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.
And neither way inclines.
And give you to the gods.
And serving you so long!
And throw between them all the food thou hast,
And threats the throat of that his officer
And all the unlawful issue that their lust
And did deserve his change. For what I have conquer'd
And other of his conquer'd kingdoms,
And his affairs come to me on the wind.
And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;
And ever welcome to us.
And gives his potent regiment to a trull
And say'st it is not fit.
And, as the president of my kingdom, will
And take in Toryne?- You have heard on't, sweet?
And so should you.
And, with the rest full-mann'd, from th' head of Actium
And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship.
And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we
And fighting foot to foot.
And we are women's men.
Another part of the plain
And so proceed accordingly.                           Exeunt
Another part of the plain
And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
And make your peace with Caesar.
And thou shouldst tow me after. O'er my spirit
And palter in the shifts of lowness, who
An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither
And in our name, what she requires; add more,
And what thou think'st his very action speaks
And leave his navy gazing.
And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
And answer me declin'd, sword against sword,
Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdu'd
And earns a place i' th' story.
And put yourself under his shroud,
And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am
Antony yet.
And whine aloud for mercy. Take him hence.
And by a gem of women, to be abus'd
And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
And plighter of high hearts! O that I were
And to proclaim it civilly were like
And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,
And poison it in the source, and the first stone
And fight maliciously. For when mine hours
And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
And feast the army; we have store to do't,
And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!          Exeunt
And kings have been your fellows.
And all of you clapp'd up together in
An Antony, that I might do you service
And suffer'd my command.
And the gods yield you for't!
And I, an ass, am onion-ey'd. For shame!
And drown consideration.                              Exeunt
And full of purpose.
And go to't with delight.
And at the port expect you.
And worthy shameful check it were, to stand
And leave his master Antony. For this pains
And feel I am so most. O Antony,
And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind.
And let the Queen know of our gests. To-morrow,
An armour all of gold; it was a king's.
And drink carouses to the next day's fate,
And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,
And look on their endeavour.                          Exeunt
And hold our best advantage.                          Exeunt
And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony
And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee
And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians;
And with those hands that grasp'd the heaviest club
And word it, prithee, piteously. Hence, Mardian,
And bring me how he takes my death. To th' monument!
And mock our eyes with air. Thou hast seen these signs;
And that she has discharg'd. What thou wouldst do  
And we must sleep. That thou depart'st hence safe
And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze.
And all the haunt be ours.- Come, Eros, Eros!
And have my thanks for all.           Exeunt, hearing ANTONY
Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian; help, Iras, help;
And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour
And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little.
And welcome, welcome! Die where thou hast liv'd.
And there is nothing left remarkable
And does the meanest chares. It were for me
And make death proud to take us. Come, away;
And citizens to their dens. The death of Antony
And with your speediest bring us what she says,
And how you find her.
And bids thee study on what fair demands
And show me to the shouting varletry
And hang me up in chains!
And he hath sent for thee. For the Queen,
An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself
And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.
And we are for the dark.
And forc'd to drink their vapour.
And when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave
Antony call. I see him rouse himself
And golden Phoebus never be beheld
And on the sudden dropp'd.
And bear her women from the monument.
And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see
And all the world was of my father's mind;
And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,
And pity her for her good father's sake;
And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
And get you from our court.  
And wheresoe'er we went, like Juno's swans,
And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
And in the greatness of my word, you die.
And do not seek to take your charge upon you,
And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
And never stir assailants.
And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
And get our jewels and our wealth together;  
And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
And this our life, exempt from public haunt,
And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
And never stays to greet him. 'Ay,' quoth Jaques
And she believes, wherever they are gone,
And let not search and inquisition quail
And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?
And you within it. If he fail of that,
And unregarded age in corners thrown.
And having that do choke their service up
And ere we have thy youthful wages spent
And faints for succour.
And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,
And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.
And little recks to find the way to heaven
And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
And willingly could waste my time in it.
And buy it with your gold right suddenly.             Exeunt
Another part of the forest
And turn his merry note
And loves to live i' th' sun,
And pleas'd with what he gets,
An if he will come to me.
And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,
And then he drew a dial from his poke,
And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear
And I did laugh sans intermission
An hour by his dial. O noble fool!  
And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
And they that are most galled with my folly,
And all th' embossed sores and headed evils
And know some nurture. But forbear, I say;
And therefore put I on the countenance
And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church,
And sat at good men's feasts, and wip'd our eyes
And therefore sit you down in gentleness,
And take upon command what help we have
And give it food. There is an old poor man  
And we will nothing waste till you return.
And all the men and women merely players;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
And shining morning face, creeping like snail  
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
And let him feed.
And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
And let me all your fortunes understand.              Exeunt
And let my officers of such a nature
And thou, thrice-crowned Queen of Night, survey
And in their barks my thoughts I'll character,
And I to live and die her slave.'
And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
Another part of the forest
And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.
And out of you she sees herself more proper
And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love;
And be not proud; though all the world could see,
And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
And I in such a poverty of grace,
And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
And, now I am rememb'red, scorn'd at me.
And thou shalt bear it; wilt thou, Silvius?
And thy father bore it.
And here much Orlando!
And play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all.
And turn'd into the extremity of love.
And by him seal up thy mind,
And then I'll study how to die.'
And browner than her brother.' Are not you
And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
And mark what object did present itself.
And high top bald with dry antiquity,
And with indented glides did slip away
And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
And he did render him the most unnatural
And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
And, after some small space, being strong at heart,
And so am I for Phebe.
And so am I for Phebe.
And so am I for Phebe.
And therefore take the present time,
And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,
And all their lands restor'd to them again
And after, every of this happy number,
And fall into our rustic revelry.
And thrown into neglect the pompous court.
And by the doom of death end woes and all.
And for what cause thou cam'st to Ephesus.
And by me, had not our hap been bad.
And the great care of goods at random left,
And soon and safe arrived where I was.
And, which was strange, the one so like the other
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
And this it was, for other means was none:
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us;
And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,
And, by the benefit of his wished light,
And in our sight they three were taken up
And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;
And happy were I in my timely death,
And passed sentence may not be recall'd
And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
And, not being able to buy out his life,
And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
And then return and sleep within mine inn;
And go indeed, having so good a mean.
And then go to my inn and dine with me?
And afterward consort you till bed time.
And wander up and down to view the city.
And strike you home without a messenger.
And tell me how thou hast dispos'd thy charge.
And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.
And many such-like liberties of sin;
And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner;
And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.
And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;
And make a common of my serious hours.
And fashion your demeanour to my looks,
And take unmingled thence that drop again
And that this body, consecrate to thee,
And hurl the name of husband in my face,
And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow,
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring,
And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
And in this mist at all adventures go.
And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
And charg'd him with a thousand marks in gold,
And that I did deny my wife and house.
And so tell your master.
And draw within the compass of suspect
And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner;
And, about evening, come yourself alone
And that supposed by the common rout
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
And in despite of mirth mean to be merry.
And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made.
And let her read it in thy looks at board;
And as a bed I'll take them, and there he;
And in that glorious supposition think
And, I think, if my breast had not been made of faith,
An if the wind blow any way from shore,
And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.
And soon at supper-time I'll visit you,
And then receive my money for the chain.
And since I have not much importun'd you;
And in the instant that I met with you
And buy a rope's end; that will I bestow
And with you take the chain, and bid my wife
And I, to blame, have held him here too long.
And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,
And told thee to what purpose and what end.
And teach your ears to list me with more heed.
And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone.
And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.
And bring thy master home immediately.
And every one doth call me by my name.
And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,
And therewithal took measure of my body.
And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.
And here we wander in illusions.
And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
And for the same he promis'd me a chain;
And tell his wife that, being lunatic,
And will not lightly trust the messenger.
And I will please you what you will demand.
And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight.
And I denied to enter in my house?
And, yielding to him, humours well his frenzy.
And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?
And art confederate with a damned pack
And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.
And, not without some scandal to yourself,
And bear him home for his recovery.
And much different from the man he was;
And thereof comes it that his head is light.
And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
And at her heels a huge infectious troop
And it shall privilege him from your hands
And will have no attorney but myself;
And therefore let me have him home with me.
And ill it doth beseem your holiness
And never rise until my tears and prayers
And take perforce my husband from the Abbess.
Anon, I'm sure, the Duke himself in person
Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
And with his mad attendant and himself,
And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us,
And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
And I to thee engag'd a prince's word,
And bid the Lady Abbess come to me,
And ever, as it blaz'd, they threw on him
And sure, unless you send some present help,
And that is false thou dost report to us.
And now he's there, past thought of human reason.
And in his company that gentleman.
And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
And in a dark and dankish vault at home
And thereupon I drew my sword on you,
And then you fled into this abbey here,
And this is false you burden me withal.
And pay the sum that may deliver me.
And is not that your bondman Dromio?
And careful hours with time's deformed hand
And all the conduits of my blood froze up,
And so of these. Which is the natural man,
And which the spirit? Who deciphers them?
And gain a husband by his liberty.
And speak unto the same Aemilia!
And the twin Dromio, all were taken up;
And me they left with those of Epidamnum.
And these two Dromios, one in semblance-
Antipholus, thou cam'st from Corinth first?
And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,
And Dromio my man did bring them me.
And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,
And thereupon these ERRORS are arose.
And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes;
And all that are assembled in this place
And we shall make full satisfaction.
And you the calendars of their nativity,
And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.
And, mutually participate, did minister
And, through the cranks and offices of man,
And leave me but the bran.' What say you to' t?
And you the mutinous members; for, examine
And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness  
And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye?
And call him noble that was now your hate,
And feebling such as stand not in their liking  
And let me use my sword, I'd make a quarry
And a petition granted them- a strange one,
And make bold power look pale- they threw their caps
And were I anything but what I am,
And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
And know how we proceed.
And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
And tread upon his neck.
And he shall feel mine edge.
And make my wars on you. Look to't. Come on;  
Another alarum. The Volsces fly, and MARCIUS follows
And when it bows stand'st up. Thou art left, Marcius;
And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle;
And then I came away.  
And bring thy news so late?
And tapers burn'd to bedward.
And that you not delay the present, but,
And balms applied to you, yet dare I never
And that his country's dearer than himself;
And follow Marcius.           [They all shout and wave their  
And four shall quickly draw out my command,
And the gods doom him after!
And made what work I pleas'd. 'Tis not my blood
And, gladly quak'd, hear more; where the dull tribunes,
And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses-
And stand upon my common part with those
An overture for th' wars. No more, I say.
And when my face is fair you shall perceive
And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity. I request you
And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
And mothers that lack sons.
And y'are welcome all.
And I could laugh; I am light and heavy. Welcome!
And the buildings of my fancy; only
And gave him graceful posture.
And the desire of the nobles.
And carry with us ears and eyes for th' time,
An o'erpress'd Roman and i' th' consul's view
And struck him on his knee. In that day's feats,
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since  
And by his rare example made the coward
And fell below his stem. His sword, death's stamp,
And with a sudden re-enforcement struck
And to the battle came he; where he did
And look'd upon things precious as they were
And keep their teeth clean. So, here comes a brace.
And mountainous error be too highly heap'd
Anon do meet the Senate.
And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
And pass'd him unelected.
And, on a safer judgment, all revoke
And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
And Censorinus, nobly named so,
And presently, when you have drawn your number,
And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,  
And straight disclaim their tongues? What are your offices?
And make your channel his? If he have power,
And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
And throw their power i' th' dust.
And follow to thine answer.
And bury all which yet distinctly ranges
And temp'rately proceed to what you would  
And bear him to the rock.
And manhood is call'd foolery when it stands  
And, being angry, does forget that ever
And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
And we their hands.
And what is left, to lose it by his country
And sack great Rome with Romans.
And you will rather show our general louts
And thus far having stretch'd it- here be with them-
And throw't against the wind. To th' market-place!
And by my body's action teach my mind
And that the spoil got on the Antiates
And when they hear me say 'It shall be so
And power i' th' truth o' th' cause.
And not our streets with war!
And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
And treasure of my loins. Then if I would
And here remain with your uncertainty!
And occupations perish!
And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime General,
And we of thee; so, if the time thrust forth
And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what- yet go!
And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?
And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go.
Antium. Before AUFIDIUS' house
And interjoin their issues. So with me:
Antium. AUFIDIUS' house
And harsh in sound to thine.  
And witness of the malice and displeasure
An suffer'd me by th' voice of slaves to be
And make my misery serve thy turn. So use it
And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
And say ''Tis true,' I'd not believe them more
And scarr'd the moon with splinters; here I clip
And wak'd half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
And take our friendly senators by th' hands,
And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
And quietness of the people, which before
And so would do, were he more angry at it.
And with the deepest malice of the war
And durst not once peep out.
And three examples of the like hath been
And beat the messenger who bids beware
And vows revenge as spacious as between
And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
And therein show'd fike enemies.
And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
And is Aufidius with him? You are they
And not a hair upon a soldier's head
And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
And show no sign of fear.
And you are dark'ned in this action, sir,
And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
And the nobility of Rome are his;
And power, unto itself most commendable,
And still to nose th' offence.
And this brave fellow too- we are the grains:
And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me.
And then I'll set upon him.
And cannot lose your way.
And with our fair entreaties haste them on.           Exeunt
And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks
And would have sent it. Another word, Menenius,
And cannot now accept. To grace him only,  
And knew no other kin.
And the most noble mother of the world  
And hangs on Dian's temple- dear Valeria!
And saving those that eye thee!
And state of bodies would bewray what life
An evident calamity, though we had
And bear the palm for having bravely shed
And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
And spurn me back; but if it he not so,
And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold's!
And then I'll speak a little.
And, sir, it is no little thing to make
And hale him up and down; all swearing if
And help the joy.                                     Exeunt
And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them.
And with his charity slain.  
And my pretext to strike at him admits
And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!
And had no welcomes home; but he returns
And trouble not the peace.
And mourn you for him. Let him be regarded
And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.
And therefore banish'd- is a creature such
And had, besides this gentleman in question,  
And in's spring became a harvest, liv'd in court-
And I shall here abide the hourly shot
And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,
And sear up my embracements from a next
And bless the good remainders of the court!
And did avoid a puttock.
And pen her up.
And had no help of anger; they were parted
And questioned'st every sail; if he should write,
And I not have it, 'twere a paper lost,
And that was all?
And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
An enemy to my son.- How now, Pisanio!  
And will not trust one of her malice with
And every day that comes comes comes to
And the remembrancer of her to hold
And greets your Highness dearly.         [Presents a letter]  
An eminent monsieur that, it seems, much loves  
And hear him mock the Frenchman. But heavens know
And will continue fast to your affection,
And yet of moment too, for it concerns
And I am something curious, being strange,
And pawn mine honour for their safety. Since
And truly yielded you. You're very welcome.           Exeunt
And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,
And if thou canst awake by four o' th' clock,
And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!
And be her sense but as a monument,
And Phoebus 'gins arise,
And winking Mary-buds begin
And then she's yours.
And therein you are senseless.
And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,
And scarce can spare them.
And am so near the lack of charity
And though it be allowed in meaner parties-
And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,
And be false with them.
And ring is yours. If not, the foul opinion
And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for
And this you might have heard of here, by me
And now 'tis up again. It must be married
And yet enrich'd it too. She gave it me, and said
And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won.
And so I hope he came by't. Back my ring.
And by a stranger! No, he hath enjoy'd her.
Another stain, as big as hell can hold,
And I will kill thee if thou dost deny
And that most venerable man which I
And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with
And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,
And his succession granted Rome a tribute,
And Britons strut with courage.  
And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike;
And our return, to excuse. But first, how get hence.
And keep their impious turbans on without
And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
And often to our comfort shall we find
And sing our bondage freely.
And felt them knowingly- the art o' th' court,
And hath as oft a sland'rous epitaph
And when a soldier was the theme, my name
And left me bare to weather.
And we will fear no poison, which attends
And thus I set my foot on's neck'; even then
And every day do honour to her grave.
And he's at some hard point. Speak, man; thy tongue
And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing
And cry myself awake? That's false to's bed,
And for I am richer than to hang by th' walls
And if I do not by thy hand, thou art
And that will well confirm it.
And with what imitation you can borrow
And, doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad-
And fit you to your manhood. May the gods
And am right sorry that I must report ye
And strokes death to her.
And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,
An earthly paragon! Behold divineness
And such a welcome as I'd give to him
And that the legions now in Gallia are
And a demand who is't shall die, I'd say
And sauc'd our broths as Juno had been sick,
And he her dieter.
And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine  
An arm as big as thine, a heart as big?
And on the gates of Lud's Town set your heads.
And burst of speaking, were as his. I am absolute
And set them on Lud's Town.
And tell the fishes he's the Queen's son, Cloten.
And put us to our answer.
And praise myself for charity.                          Exit
And make him stoop to th' vale. 'Tis wonder
And brings the dire occasion in his arms
Answer'd my steps too loud.
And worms will not come to thee.
And do not play in wench-like words with that
And not protract with admiration what
And let us, Polydore, though now our voices
And though he came our enemy, remember
And though you took his life, as being our foe,
And renowned be thy grave!
And cook to honest creatures. But 'tis not so;
And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,
And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?  
And cordial to me, have I not found it
And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,  
And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is here
And on it said a century of prayers,  
And leaving so his service, follow you,
And rather father thee than master thee.
And make him with our pikes and partisans
And will no doubt be found.
And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not
And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,
And make them dread it, to the doer's thrift.
And make me blest to obey. I am brought hither  
Another part of the field
And but the backs of Britons seen, an flying,
An honest one, I warrant, who deserv'd
And vent it for a mock'ry? Here is one:
And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,
And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!
And to become the geck and scorn
And potent injuries.
And from thy justice fly.
And happier much by his affliction made.
And so, away; no farther with your din
And so I am awake. Poor wretches, that depend
And yet are steep'd in favours; so am I,
And not o' th' court of Britain.
And but she spoke it dying, I would not
And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!
And spare no blood beside.
And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore  
And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,
And yet I know thou wilt.
And lend my best attention. What's thy name?
And not dispraising whom we prais'd- therein
And then a mind put in't, either our brags
And she alone were cold; whereat I, wretch,
And would so, had it been a carbuncle
And, to be brief, my practice so prevail'd
And am right glad he is not standing here
And take him from our presence.
And let it be confiscate all, so soon
And think they are my sons, are none of mine;
And blood of your begetting.
And when came you to serve our Roman captive?
And your three motives to the battle, with
And all the other by-dependences,
And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye
And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.
And here the bracelet of the truest princess
And deal with others better.
Answering the letter of the oracle,
And to the Roman empire, promising
And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
And in the temple of great Jupiter
And I am sick at heart.
And will not let belief take hold of him
And let us once again assail your ears,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
And foreign mart for implements of war;
And carriage of the article design'd,
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
And prologue to the omen coming on,
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
An understanding simple and unschool'd;
And with no less nobility of love
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
And vanish'd from our sight.
And we did think it writ down in our duty
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
And keep you in the rear of your affection,  
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
And recks not his own rede.
And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
And these few precepts in thy memory
And they in France of the best rank and station
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
And it must follow, as the night the day,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
And that in way of caution- I must tell you
And with a larger tether may he walk
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
And to the manner born, it is a custom
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
And there assume some other, horrible form
And draw you into madness? Think of it.
And hears it roar beneath.
And makes each petty artire in this body
And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
And each particular hair to stand an end
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed  
And prey on garbage.
And in the porches of my ears did pour
And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,  
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
And thy commandment all alone shall live
And so, without more circumstance at all,
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
And lay your hands again upon my sword.
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
And with a look so piteous in purport
And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
And to the last bended their light on me.
And leads the will to desperate undertakings
And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
And sure I am two men there are not living
And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
And I beseech you instantly to visit
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
And I do think- or else this brain of mine
And his commission to employ those soldiers,
And at our more consider'd time we'll read,  
Answer, and think upon this business.
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
And more above, hath his solicitings,
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
And all we mourn for.  
And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
And passion in the gods.'
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
And, as I think, they have already order
And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
And drive his purpose on to these delights.
And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
And pious action we do sugar o'er  
And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
And thus the native hue of resolution
And enterprises of great pith and moment
And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
And could of men distinguish, her election
And my imaginations are as foul
And after we will both our judgments join
And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
And thirty dozed moons with borrowed sheen
And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
And never come mischance between us twain!
And do such bitter business as the day
And he to England shall along with you.
And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
And tell you what I know.
And, like a man to double business bound,
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame  
And reason panders will.
And there I see such black and grained spots
And put it in his pocket!  
And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
And I the matter will reword; which madness
And do not spread the compost on the weeds
And live the purer with the other half,
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
And when you are desirous to be blest,
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
And break your own neck down.
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
And in this brainish apprehension kills
And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
And let them know both what we mean to do
And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
And bear it to the chapel.
And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
And let him know so.
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
And his sandal shoon.
And I a maid at your window,
And dupp'd the chamber door,
An thou hadst not come to my bed.'
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
And, as the world were now but to begin,
Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
And for my means, I'll husband them so well
And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
And am most sensibly in grief for it,
And in his grave rain'd many a tear.
And will he not come again?
And will he not come again?
And we cast away moan.
And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi', you.
And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
And we shall jointly labour with your soul
And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
And do't the speedier that you may direct me
And You must put me in your heart for friend,
And not where I had aim'd them.
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-  
And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
And for his death no wind
And call it accident.
And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
And they can well on horseback; but this gallant  
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
And gem of all the nation.
And gave you such a masterly report
And for your rapier most especially,
And that I see, in passages of proof,
And nothing is at a like goodness still;
And hath abatements and delays as many  
And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
And set a double varnish on the fame
And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
And that our drift look through our bad performance.
And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
And hath shipped me intil the land,
And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh  
And not have strew'd thy grave.
And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
And thus a while the fit will work on him.
Anon, as patient as the female dove
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
And many such-like as's of great charge,
And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
And hurt my brother.
And will not wrong it.
And will this brother's wager frankly play.
And in the cup an union shall he throw
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
And our affairs from England come too late.  
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
And call the noblest to the audience.
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
And furious close of civil butchery,
And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go.
And many limits of the charge set down
And shape of likelihood the news was told;
And pride of their contention did take horse,
And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
And is not this an honourable spoil?
And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!
And for this cause awhile we must neglect
And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
And pay the debt I never promised,
And, like bright metal on a sullen ground,
And you have found me, for accordingly
And therefore lost that title of respect
And that same greatness too which our own hands
And majesty might never yet endure
And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
Answer'd neglectingly, I know not what-
And talk so like a waiting gentlewoman
And telling me the sovereignest thing on earth
And that it was great pity, so it was,
And I beseech you, let not his report
And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
And tell him so; for I will else my heart,
And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,
And when I urg'd the ransom once again
And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,
And then it was when the unhappy King
And for his sake wear the detested blot
And plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?
And shall it in more shame be further spoken
And now, I will unclasp a secret book,
And to your quick-conceiving discontents
And let them grapple. O, the blood more stirs
And pluck up drowned honour by the locks,
And lend no ear unto my purposes.
And in his ear I'll holloa 'Mortimer.'
And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales-
And would be glad he met with some mischance,
And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin'-
And make the Douglas' son your only mean
And only stays but to behold the face
And then the power of Scotland and of York
And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,
And see already how he doth begin
An the Prince and Poins be not two arrant cowards, there's no
And lards the lean earth as he walks along.
And start so often when thou sit'st alone?
And given my treasures and my rights of thee
And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars,
And all the currents of a heady fight.
And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,
And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,  
And I must know it, else he loves me not.
An if thou wilt not tell my all things true.
And pass them current too. Gods me, my horse!  
And when I am a-horseback, I will swear
And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.
And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee
And so let me entreat you leave the house.
And our induction full of prosperous hope.
And uncle Worcester. A plague upon it!
And not in fear of your nativity.
And all the courses of my life do show
And bring him out that is but woman's son
And hold me pace in deep experiments.
And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.
And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him
And all the fertile land within that bound,  
And our indentures tripartite are drawn;
And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
And in my conduct shall your ladies come,
And cuts me from the best of all my land
And here the smug and sliver Trent shall run
And on this north side win this cape of land;
And then he runs straight and even.
And gave the tongue a helpful ornament-
And I am glad of it with all my heart!
And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,
And of a dragon and a finless fish,
And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
And wondrous affable, and as bountiful
And curbs himself even of his natural scope
And since your coming hither have done enough
And that's the dearest grace it renders you-
And that's a feeling disputation.
And rest your gentle head upon her lap,
And she will sing the song that pleaseth you
And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep,
And those musicians that shall play to you
And straight they shall be here. Sit, and attend.
And 'tis no marvel, be is so humorous.
And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths
And such protest of pepper gingerbread
And then to horse immediately.
And hold their level with thy princely heart?
And pardon on lily true submission.
And art almost an alien to the hearts
And left me in reputeless banishment,
And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,
And dress'd myself in such humility
And won by rareness such solemnity.
And gave his countenance, against his name,
And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;
And even as I was then is Percy now.
And, Being no more in debt to years than thou,
And military title capital
And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,
And God forgive them that so much have sway'd
And, in the closing of some glorious day,
And stain my favours in a bloody mask,
And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,
And your unthought of Harry chance to meet.
And I will call hall to so strict account
And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
And either they or we must lower lie.                [Exit.]
And at the time of my departure thence
And that his friends by deputation could not
And yet, in faith, it is not! His present want
And think how such an apprehension
And breed a kind of question in our cause.
And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence
And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside
And bid it pass?
And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;
And vaulted with such ease into his seat
And witch the world with noble horsemanship.
And to the fire-ey'd maid of smoky war
And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,
And I dare well maintain it with my life-
And now their pride and mettle is asleep,
And pardon absolute for yourself and these
And when he was not six-and-twenty strong,
And when he heard him swear and vow to God
And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform
And in the neck of that task'd the whole state;
And in conclusion drove us to seek out
And In the morning early shall mine uncle
And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,  
And comes not in, overrul'd by prophecies-
And there is my Lord of Worcester, and a head
And many moe corrivals and dear men
And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed.
And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him.
And by his hollow whistling in the leaves
And made us doff our easy robes of peace  
And move in that obedient orb again
And be no more an exhal'd meteor,
And yet I must remember you, my lord,  
And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,
And such a flood of greatness fell on you-
And the contrarious winds that held the King  
And from this swarm of fair advantages
And, being fed by us, you us'd us so
And violation of all faith and troth
And never yet did insurrection want
And so I hear he doth account me too.
And will to save the blood on either side,
And, will they take the offer of our grace,
And they shall do their office. So be gone.  
And God befriend us as our cause is just!
And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,
And an adopted name of privilege-
And on his father's. We did train him on;
And, his corruption being taken from us,
And Westmoreland, that was engag'd, did bear it;
And, nephew, challeng'd you to single fight.
And that no man might draw short breath to-day  
And, which became him like a prince indeed,
And chid his truant youth with such a grace
An if we live, we live to tread on kings;  
And by that music let us all embrace;
And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
Another part of the field.
And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive
And rebels' arms triumph in massacres!
And not the very King. I have two boys  
And yet, in faith, thou bearest thee like a king.
And thus I win thee.
And so hath Clifton. I'll to Clifton straight.
And show'd thou mak'st some tender of my life,
And sav'd the treacherous labour of your son.
And all the budding honours on thy crest
And time, that takes survey of all the world,
And food for-                                        [Dies.]
And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself
Another part of the field.
And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?
And I embrace this fortune patiently,
And falling from a hill,he was so bruis'd
And since this business so fair is done,
And who but Rumour, who but only I,
And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe
And of so easy and so plain a stop  
And that the King before the Douglas' rage
And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,
And not a man of them brings other news
And he himself will answer.
And bears down all before him.
And, in the fortune of my lord your son,
And Westmoreland, and Stafford, fled the field;
And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,
And he is furnish'd with no certainties
And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.  
And, bending forward, struck his armed heels
And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;
And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.  
And I will take it as a sweet disgrace
And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.
And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,
And as the thing that's heavy in itself
And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.
And as the wretch whose fever-weak'ned joints,
And let this world no longer be a stage
And darkness be the burier of the dead!
And summ'd the account of chance before you said
And yet we ventur'd, for the gain propos'd
And since we are o'erset, venture again.
And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,
And doth enlarge his rising with the blood
And more and less do flock to follow him.
And, my most noble friends, I pray you all
And first, Lord Marshal, what say you to it?
And our supplies live largely in the hope
And so, with great imagination
And, winking, leapt into destruction.
And when we see the figure of the house,
And set another up- should we survey
And waste for churlish winter's tyranny.
And one against Glendower; perforce a third
And come against us in full puissance
And publish the occasion of our arms.
An habitation giddy and unsure
And being now trimm'd in thine own desires,
And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,
And howl'st to find it. What trust is in these times?
And take thou this!' O thoughts of men accurs'd!
And didst thou not kiss me, and bid me fetch the thirty
And be, like them, to Percy troublesome.
And but my going nothing can redeem it.
And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,
And find me worse provided.
And never shall have length of life enough
And hollow pamper'd jades of Asia,
And Troiant Greeks? Nay, rather damn them with
And there are twenty weak and wearied posts
And asking every one for Sir John Falstaff.
And drop upon our bare unarmed heads.
And well consider of them. Make good speed.        Exit page
And steep my senses in forgetfulness?
And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,
And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody?
And in the visitation of the winds,
And in the calmest and most stillest night,
And with what danger, near the heart of it.
And see the revolution of the times
And changes fill the cup of alteration
And laid his love and life under my foot;
And the division of our amity.
And weak beginning lie intreasured.
And, by the necessary form of this,
And that same word even now cries out on us.
And these unseasoned hours perforce must ad
And, were these inward wars once out of hand,
And this same half-fac'd fellow, Shadow- give me this man. He
And fearful meeting of their opposite.
And dash themselves to pieces.
And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number
And countenanc'd by boys and beggary-
And with our surfeiting and wanton hours
And we must bleed for it; of which disease
And purge th' obstructions which begin to stop
And find our griefs heavier than our offences.
And are enforc'd from our most quiet there
And have the summary of all our griefs,
And might by no suit gain our audience:
And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?
And suffer the condition of these times
And you shall say, indeed, it is the time,
And not the King, that doth you injuries.  
And then that Henry Bolingbroke and he,
And the loud trumpet blowing them together-
And bless'd and grac'd indeed more than the King.
And it proceeds from policy, not love.
And present execution of our wills
And knit our powers to the arm of peace.
And either end in peace- which God so frame!-
And good from bad find no partition.
And therefore will he wipe his tables clean,
And keep no tell-tale to his memory
And hangs resolv'd correction in the arm
And therefore be assur'd, my good Lord Marshal,
Another part of the forest
And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.
And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,
And our dull workings. O, who shall believe
And both against the peace of heaven and him
And true obedience, of this madness cur'd,
And so success of mischief shall be born,
And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up
And swear here, by the honour of my blood,
And some about him have too lavishly
And thereupon I drink unto your Grace.
And neither party loser.
And let our army be discharged too.
And, good my lord, so please you let our trains
And, ere they be dismiss'd, let them march by.
And you, Lord Archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray,
Another part of the forest
An I had but a belly of any indifferency, I were simply the most
And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords.
And we with sober speed will follow you.
And draw no swords but what are sanctified.
And everything lies level to our wish.
And pause us till these rebels, now afoot,
And noble offices thou mayst effect
And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,
And he, the noble image of my youth,
And rotten times that you shall look upon
And, when they stand against you, may they fall
And takes away the stomach- such are the rich
And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy.
And the old folk, Time's doting chronicles,
And helps to end me. See, sons, what things you are!
And thou wilt have me die assur'd of it.
And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
And to the English court assemble now,
And he that wears the crown immortally
And found no course of breath within your Majesty,
And never live to show th' incredulous world
And dead almost, my liege, to think you were-
And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending
And make me as the poorest vassal is,
And hear, I think, the very latest counsel
And I had many living to upbraid
And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,
And by whose power I well might lodge a fear
And grant it may with thee in true peace live!
And to our purposes he lives no more.
And I dare swear you borrow not that face
And never shall you see that I will beg
And tell him who hath sent me after him.
And wear it in my heart. Why, then, be sad;
And in th' administration of his law,
And struck me in my very seat of judgment;
And did commit you. If the deed were ill,
And mock your workings in a second body.
And then imagine me taking your part
And, in your power, soft silencing your son.
And, as you are a king, speak in your state
And I do wish your honours may increase
And not less happy, having such a son
And I will stoop and humble my intents
And, Princes all, believe me, I beseech you,
And with his spirits sadly I survive,
And flow henceforth in formal majesty.
And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,
And- God consigning to my good intents-
And praise God for the merry year;
And lusty lads roam here and there,
And ever among so merrily.
And welcome merry Shrove-tide.
And drink unto the leman mine;
And a merry heart lives long-a.
And dub me knight.
And helter-skelter have I rode to thee;
And tidings do I bring, and lucky joys,
And golden times, and happy news of price.
And shall good news be baffled?
And make thee rage.
And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!
And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,
And make imaginary puissance;
And, to relief of lazars and weak age,
And to the coffers of the King, beside,
And whipp'd th' offending Adam out of him,
And, all-admiring, with an inward wish
And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears
And never noted in him any study,
Any retirement, any sequestration
And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
And so the Prince obscur'd his contemplation
And therefore we must needs admit the means  
And in regard of causes now in hand,
And generally to the crown and seat of France,
And make you long become it!
And justly and religiously unfold  
And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,
And rather choose to hide them in a net
And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,
And let another half stand laughing by,
And with your puissant arm renew their feats.
And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.
And she a mourning widow of her nobles,
And make her chronicle as rich with praise
And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.
And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.
And yours, the noble sinews of our power,
And bids you be advis'd there's nought in France
And therefore, living hence, did give ourself
And plodded like a man for working-days;
And tell the pleasant Prince this mock of his  
And some are yet ungotten and unborn
And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies;
And hides a sword from hilts unto the point
And by their hands this grace of kings must die-
And thence to France shall we convey you safe
And bring you back, charming the narrow seas  
And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy;
And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!
And flashing fire will follow.
And from the powd'ring tub of infamy
And liquor likewise will I give to thee,
And friendship shall combine, and brotherhood.
And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts.
And shall forget the office of our hand  
And labour shall refresh itself with hope,
And on his more advice we pardon him.
And tender preservation of our person,
And do submit me to your Highness' mercy.
And sworn unto the practices of France
And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
And other devils that suggest by treasons
And tell the legions 'I can never win
And but in purged judgment trusting neither?
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot
Another fall of man. Their faults are open.
And God acquit them of their practices!
And I repent my fault more than my death;  
And his whole kingdom into desolation.
And we must earn therefore.
And Holdfast is the only dog, my duck.
And more than carefully it us concerns
And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,
And let us do it with no show of fear-
And you shall find his vanities forespent
And, Princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.
And he is bred out of that bloody strain
And all our princes capdv'd by the hand
And all wide-stretched honours that pertain,
And when you find him evenly deriv'd
And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,
And anything that may not misbecome
And be assur'd you'll find a difference,
And these he masters now. Now he weighs time
And leave your England as dead midnight still,
And down goes an before them. Still be kind,
And eke out our performance with your mind.             Exit
And sheath'd their swords for lack of argument.
And teach them how to war. And you, good yeomen,
And sword and shield
And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart,
And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls;  
And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French;
And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.
And overlook their grafters?
And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine,
And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos,
And that we are most lofty runaways.
And in a captive chariot into Rouen
And for achievement offer us his ransom.
And let him say to England that we send
And quickly bring us word of England's fall.          Exeunt
And of buxom valour, hath by cruel fate
And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel,
And let not hemp his windpipe suffocate.
And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut
And tell thy king I do not seek him now,
And on to-morrow bid them march away.                 Exeunt
And the third hour of drowsy morning name.
And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night
And calls them brothers, friends, and countrymen.
And so our scene must to the battle fly;
And preachers to us all, admonishing
And make a moral of the devil himself.
And when the mind is quick'ned, out of doubt
And then I would no other company.
And what have kings that privates have not too,
And what art thou, thou idol Ceremony?
And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!
And follows so the ever-running year
And but for ceremony, such a wretch,
And on it have bestowed more contrite tears
And dout them with superfluous courage, ha!
And your fair show shall suck away their souls,
And sheathe for lack of sport. Let us but blow on them,
And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound
And our air shakes them passing scornfully;
And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps.
And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal'd bit
And their executors, the knavish crows,
And give their fasting horses provender,
And after fight with them?
And use it for my haste. Come, come, away!
And my kind kinsman- warriors all, adieu!
And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it,
And crowns for convoy put into his purse;
And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian.'
And say 'These wounds I had on Crispian's day.'
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,
And gentlemen in England now-a-bed
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
And will with all expedience charge on us.
And those that leave their valiant bones in France,
And draw their honours reeking up to heaven,
And time hath worn us into slovenry.
And my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night
And turn them out of service. If they do this-
And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day!          Exeunt
Another part of the field of battle
And he that will not follow Bourbon now,
Another part of the field
And takes him by the beard, kisses the gashes
And, with a feeble grip, says 'Dear my lord,
And so, espous'd to death, with blood he seal'd
And all my mother came into mine eyes
And gave me up to tears.
Another part of the field
And make them skirr away as swift as stones
And not a man of them that we shall take
And gallop o'er the field.
And touch'd with choler, hot as gunpowder,
And quickly will return an injury;
And thou hast given me most bitter terms.
And give it to this fellow. Keep it, fellow;
And wear it for an honour in thy cap
And, Captain, you must needs be friends with him.
And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead
And gentlemen of blood and quality.
And Edward Duke of Bar. Of lusty earls,
And not to us, but to thy arm alone,
And be it death proclaimed through our host
And then to Calais; and to England then;
And solemnly see him set on to London.
And there my rendezvous is quite cut off.  
And something lean to cutpurse of quick hand.
And patches will I get unto these cudgell'd scars,
And swear I got them in the Gallia wars.                Exit
And, as a branch and member of this royalty,
And, princes French, and peers, health to you all!
And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,
And as our vineyards, fallows, meads, and hedges,
And everything that seems unnatural.
And bless us with her former qualities.
And brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester,
And take with you free power to ratify,
Any thing in or out of our demands;
And we'll consign thereto. Will you, fair sister,
And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
And thereupon give me your daughter.
And all the peers', for surety of our leagues.
And may our oaths well kept and prosp'rous be!
And of it left his son imperial lord.
And with them scourge the bad revolting stars
And death's dishonourable victory
And lookest to command the Prince and realm.
And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st,
And none but women left to wail the dead.
And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,
Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;
An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,  
And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.
And Lord Scales with him, and Lord Hungerford;
And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,
And then I will proclaim young Henry king.              Exit
And for his safety there I'll best devise.              Exit
And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.             Exeunt
And have their provender tied to their mouths,
And he may well in fretting spend his gall
And hunger will enforce them to be more eager.
And drive the English forth the bounds of France.
And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,
And in a vision full of majesty
And free my country from calamity  
And whereas I was black and swart before,
And I will answer unpremeditated.
And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.
And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true;
And fightest with the sword of Deborah.
And not Protector of the King or realm.
And would have armour here out of the Tower,
And how the English have the suburbs won.
And thence discover how with most advantage
And even these three days have I watch'd
And thou shalt find me at the Governor's.               Exit
And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground
And spurn in pieces posts of adamant;
And if I did but stir out of my bed,
And view the Frenchmen how they fortify.
And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.
And then we'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.
And straightway give thy soul to him thou serv'st.
And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder,
And feast and banquet in the open streets
And all the priests and friars in my realm
And now there rests no other shift but this
And lay new platforms to endamage them.  
And here advance it in the market-place,
And that hereafter ages may behold
And what a terror he had been to France.
And therefore tell her I return great thanks  
And in submission will attend on her.
And I have heard it said unbidden guests
And when you have done so, bring the keys to me.
And his achievements of no less account.
And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.
And for that cause I train'd thee to my house.
And I will chain these legs and arms of thine
And sent our sons and husbands captivate.
And least proportion of humanity.
And in a moment makes them desolate.
And more than may be gathered by thy shape.
And never yet could frame my will to it;
And therefore frame the law unto my will.
And stands upon the honour of his birth,
And say withal I think he held the right.
And fall on my side so, against your will.
And keep me on the side where still I am.  
And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.
And by his treason stand'st not thou attainted,
And till thou be restor'd thou art a yeoman.
And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,
And know us by these colours for thy foes
And so farewell until I meet thee next.                 Exit
And if thou be not then created York,
And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,
And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,
And pithless arms, like to a withered vine
And answer was return'd that he will come.
And even since then hath Richard been obscur'd,
And in his bosom spend my latter gasp.
And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,
And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease.
And did upbraid me with my father's death;
And for alliance sake, declare the cause  
And hath detain'd me all my flow'ring youth
And death approach not ere my tale be done.
And have install'd me in the diadem;
And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,
And that my fainting words do warrant death.
And like a mountain not to be remov'd.
And so, farewell; and fair be all thy hopes,
And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!          [Dies]
And like a hermit overpass'd thy days.
And what I do imagine, let that rest.
And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,
And therefore haste I to the Parliament,
And for thy treachery, what's more manifest
And for dissension, who preferreth peace
And that engenders thunder in his breast
And makes him roar these accusations forth.
And useth it to patronage his theft.
And know the office that belongs to such.
And, banding themselves in contrary parts,  
And we for fear compell'd to shut our shops.
And set this unaccustom'd fight aside.
And ere that we will suffer such a prince,
And have our bodies slaught'red by thy foes.
And if you love me, as you say you do,
And will not you maintain the thing you teach,
An if your Grace mark every circumstance,
And humble service till the point of death.
And in reguerdon of that duty done
And rise created princely Duke of York.
And as my duty springs, so perish they
And will at last break out into a flame;
And now I fear that fatal prophecy.
And Henry born at Windsor should lose all.
And that we find the slothful watch but weak,
And we be lords and rulers over Rouen;
And once again we'll sleep secure in Rouen.
And then do execution on the watch. Alarum.           Exeunt
An alarum. Enter TALBOT in an excursion
An alarum; excursions. BEDFORD brought in sick in  
And make thee curse the harvest of that corn.
And run a tilt at death within a chair?
And twit with cowardice a man half dead?  
And dare not take up arms like gentlemen.
And I, as sure as English Henry lives
And as his father here was conqueror,
And will be partner of your weal or woe.
And now no more ado, brave Burgundy,
And set upon our boasting enemy.
An alarum; excursions. Enter SIR JOHN FASTOLFE,
An alarum. Re-enter TALBOT, BURGUNDY, and the rest
And then depart to Paris to the King,
And like a peacock sweep along his tail;
And of thy cunning had no diffidence;
And we will make thee famous through the world.
And have thee reverenc'd like a blessed saint.  
And not have tide of an earldom here.
And all the troops of English after him.
And see the cities and the towns defac'd
And wash away thy country's stained spots.
And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill,
And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?
And was he not in England prisoner?
And join'st with them will be thy slaughtermen.
And made me almost yield upon my knees.
And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace.
And doth deserve a coronet of gold.
And seek how we may prejudice the foe.                Exeunt
And with submissive loyalty of heart
And in our coronation take your place.
And, after, meet you sooner than you would.           Exeunt
And none your foes but such as shall pretend
And that the French were almost ten to one,
And ill beseeming any common man,
And should, if I were worthy to be judge,
And now, my Lord Protector, view the letter
And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.'
And give him chastisement for this abuse.
And what offence it is to flout his friends.
And wherefore crave you combat, or with whom?
And in defence of my lord's worthiness,
And he first took exceptions at this badge,
And then your Highness shall command a peace.
And perish ye, with your audacious prate!
And you, my lords- methinks you do not well
And you, my lords, remember where we are:
And that within ourselves we disagree,
And, therefore, as we hither came in peace,  
And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite
And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,
And thus he would open your city gates,
And do him homage as obedient subjects,
And I'll withdraw me and my bloody power;
And strong enough to issue out and fight.
And no way canst thou turn thee for redress
And pale destruction meets thee in the face.
And mine shall ring thy dire departure out.             Exit
And make the cowards stand aloof at bay.
And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends.
And I am louted by a traitor villain
And cannot help the noble chevalier.  
And hemm'd about with grim destruction.
And on his son, young John, who two hours since
And now they meet where both their lives are done.
And whiles the honourable captain there
And, in advantage ling'ring, looks for rescue,
And Talbot perisheth by your default.
And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending.
And fly would Talbot never, though he might.
And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape
And shall I fly? O, if you love my mother,
And soul with soul from France to heaven fly.         Exeunt
And left us to the rage of France his sword.
And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee.
And, interchanging blows, I quickly shed
And misbegotten blood I spill of thine,
And like me to the peasant boys of France,
An if I fly, I am not Talbot's son;
And, commendable prov'd, let's die in pride.          Exeunt
Another part of the field
And like a hungry lion did commence
And in that sea of blood my boy did drench
Anon, from thy insulting tyranny,
And to survey the bodies of the dead.
And give them burial as beseems their worth.
And now to Paris in this conquering vein!
And stablish quietness on every side.
And surer bind this knot of amity,  
And fitter is my study and my books
And call'd unto a cardinal's degree?
And therefore are we certainly resolv'd
And so, my Lord Protector, see them guarded
And safely brought to Dover; where inshipp'd,
And turn again unto the warlike French.
And keep not back your powers in dalliance.
And happiness to his accomplices!
And means to give you battle presently.
And ye choice spirits that admonish me
And give me signs of future accidents;             [Thunder]
And let her head fall into England's lap.
And hell too strong for me to buckle with.
And try if they can gain your liberty.
And may ye both be suddenly surpris'd
And lay them gently on thy tender side.
And peace established between these realms.
And our nobility will scorn the match.
And will not any way dishonour me.
And then I need not crave his courtesy.
And set a precious crown upon thy head,
And have no portion in the choice myself.
And, madam, at your father's castle walls
And this her easy-held imprisonment
And those two counties I will undertake
And make this marriage to be solemniz'd.
And natural graces that extinguish art;
And, now it is my chance to find thee out,
And for thy sake have I shed many a tear.
And here at hand the Dauphin and his train
And sold their bodies for their country's benefit,
An suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,
And, Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear
And still enjoy thy regal dignity.
And yet, in substance and authority,
And therein reverenc'd for their lawful king.
And now the matter grows to compromise
And not of any challenge of desert,
And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
And therefore take this compact of a truce,
And like as rigour of tempestuous gusts
And, which is more, she is not so divine,
And not deface your honour with reproach?
And therefore may be broke without offence.  
And of such great authority in France
And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.
And not to seek a queen to make him rich.
And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,
An age of discord and continual strife?
And is a pattern of celestial peace.
And you, good uncle, banish all offence:
And so conduct me where, from company,
And humbly now upon my bended knee,
And over-joy of heart doth minister.
And dimm'd mine eyes, that I can read no further.
And girt thee with the sword. Cousin of York,
And did my brother Bedford toil his wits
And had his Highness in his infancy
And shall these labours and these honours die?  
Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both;
And are the cities that I got with wounds
And our King Henry gives away his own
And no great friend, I fear me, to the King.
And heir apparent to the English crown.
And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,
And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,
And greatness of his place be grief to us,
And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland,  
And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds
And common profit of his country!
And would have kept so long as breath did last.
And purchase friends, and give to courtezans,
And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof,
Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!
And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts,
And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,
And when I spy advantage, claim the crown,
And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars;  
And in my standard bear the arms of York,
And force perforce I'll make him yield the crown,
And having both together heav'd it up,
And never more abase our sight so low
And may that thought, when I imagine ill
And on the pieces of the broken wand
And William de la Pole, first Duke of Suffolk.
And in that chair where kings and queens were crown'd;
And on my head did set the diadem.
And the Protector's wife, belov'd of him?
And wilt thou still be hammering treachery
And not be check'd.
And smooth my way upon their headless necks;
And, being a woman, I will not be slack
And will they undertake to do me good?
And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk;
And buzz these conjurations in her brain.
And her attainture will be Humphrey's fall
And this the royalty of Albion's king?
And must be made a subject to a duke?
And stol'st away the ladies' hearts of France,
And set the triple crown upon his head;
And grumbling York; and not the least of these
And in her heart she scorns our poverty;
And plac'd a quire of such enticing birds
And never mount to trouble you again.
And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.
And at his pleasure will resign my place.
And all the peers and nobles of the realm
And left thee to the mercy of the law.
And listen after Humphrey, how he proceeds.  
And that your Majesty was an usurper.
And let these have a day appointed them
And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves-
And kept asunder. You, madam, shall with us.
And hardly understood.
And ten to one old Joan had not gone out.
And what a pitch she flew above the rest!
And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.
An't like your lordly Lord's Protectorship.
And made me climb, With danger of my life.
And other of your Highness' Privy Council,
And, vanquish'd as I am, I yield to the
And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.  
And for my wife I know not how it stands.
And give her as a prey to law and shame,
And call these foul offenders to their answers,
And poise the cause in justice' equal scales,
And left behind him Richard, his only son,
And him to Pomfret, where, as all you know,
And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,
And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.
And in this private plot be we the first
And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,
And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.
And go in peace, Humphrey, no less belov'd
And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it
And Humphrey Duke of Gloucester scarce himself,
And ready are the appellant and defendant,
And God in justice hath reveal'd to us
And after summer evermore succeeds
And nod their heads and throw their eyes on thee;
And, in thy closet pent up, rue my shame
And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine!
And thou a prince, Protector of this land,
And follow'd with a rabble that rejoice
And when I start, the envious people laugh
And bid me be advised how I tread.
And he a prince, and ruler of the land;
And York, and impious Beaufort, that false priest,
And, fly thou how thou canst, they'll tangle thee.
And had I twenty times so many foes,
And each of them had twenty times their power,
And Sir John Stanley is appointed now
And I may live to do you kindness if
And shall I then be us'd reproachfully?
And go we to attire you for our journey.
And show itself, attire me how I can.
And if we did but glance a far-off look
And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,  
And Humphrey is no little man in England.
And should you fall he is the next will mount;
And his advantage following your decease-
And when he please to make commotion,
And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.
And had I first been put to speak my mind,
And such high vaunts of his nobility,
And in his simple show he harbours treason.
And caterpillars eat my leaves away;
And, being Protector, stay'd the soldiers' pay;
And never ask'd for restitution.
And lowly words were ransom for their fault.
And here commit you to my Lord Cardinal
And charity chas'd hence by rancour's hand;
And equity exil'd your Highness' land.
And if my death might make this island happy
And prove the period of their tyranny,
And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate;
And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,
And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,
And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up
And all to make away my guiltless life.
And the offender granted scope of speech,
And well such losers may have leave to speak.
And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.
And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come
And as the butcher takes away the calf,  
And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,
And as the dam runs lowing up and down,
And can do nought but wail her darling's loss,
And yet herein I judge mine own wit good-
And yet we have but trivial argument,
And do not stand on quillets how to slay him;
And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,
And I'll provide his executioner-
And put the Englishmen unto the sword.
And temper clay with blood of Englishmen;
And try your hap against the Irishmen?
And what we do establish he confirms;
And so break off; the day is almost spent.
And change misdoubt to resolution;
And find no harbour in a royal heart.
And not a thought but thinks on dignity.
And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
And for a minister of my intent
And fought so long tiff that his thighs with darts
And in the end being rescu'd, I have seen
And undiscover'd come to me again
And given me notice of their villainies.
And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;
And Henry put apart, the next for me.                   Exit
And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,
And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight;
And for myself- foe as he was to me-
And all to have the noble Duke alive.  
And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.
And make my image but an alehouse sign.
And twice by awkward wind from England's bank
And he that loos'd them forth their brazen caves;
And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,
And would not dash me with their ragged sides,
And when the dusky sky began to rob  
And threw it towards thy land. The sea receiv'd it;
And so I wish'd thy body might my heart.
And even with this I lost fair England's view,
And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,
And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles
And care not who they sting in his revenge.
And comment then upon his sudden death.
And with my fingers feel his hand un-feeling;
And to survey his dead and earthy image,
And tugg'd for life, and was by strength subdu'd.
And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.
And you, forsooth, had the good Duke to keep.
And 'tis well seen he found an enemy.
And sees fast by a butcher with an axe,
And never of the Nevils' noble race.  
And I should rob the deathsman of his fee,
And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild,
And say it was thy mother that thou meant'st,
And, after all this fearful homage done,
And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost.
And he but naked, though lock'd up in steel,  
And torture him with grievous ling'ring death.
And mere instinct of love and loyalty,
And charge that no man should disturb your rest,
And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,
And had I not been cited so by them,
And therefore by His Majesty I swear,
And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!  
And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave.
And even now my burden'd heart would break,
And boding screech-owls make the consort full!
And these dread curses, like the sun 'gainst glass,
And turns the force of them upon thyself.
And think it but a minute spent in sport.
And banished I am, if but from thee.
And where thou art not, desolation.  
And whispers to his pillow, as to him,
And I am sent to tell his Majesty
And with the southern clouds contend in tears-
And in thy sight to die, what were it else
And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,
And then it liv'd in sweet Elysium.
And from his bosom purge this black despair!
And let us all to meditation.                         Exeunt
And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades
And thou that art his mate make boot of this;
And bear the name and port of gentlemen?
And so should these, if I might have my will.
And told me that by water I should die;
And I proclaim'd a coward through the world.
And thought thee happy when I shook my head?
And duly waited for my coming forth.
And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.
And thou that smil'dst at good Duke Humphrey's death
And wedded be thou to the hags of hell
And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorg'd
And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home.
And now the house of York- thrust from the crown
And lofty proud encroaching tyranny-
And to conclude, reproach and beggary
And all by thee. Away! convey him hence.
And sooner dance upon a bloody pole
And thou thyself a shearman, art thou not?
And, ignorant of his birth and parentage,
And you that be the King's friends, follow me.
Another part of Blackheath
And makes it fearful and degenerate;
And could it not enforce them to relent
And calls your Grace usurper, openly,
And vows to crown himself in Westminster.
And therefore in this city will I stay
And live alone as secret as I may.
And therefore am I bold and resolute.                 Exeunt
And thither I will send you Matthew Goffe;
And so, farewell, for I must hence again.             Exeunt
And seeing ignorance is the curse of God,
And therefore yet relent and save my life.
And therefore yet relent, and save my life.
And here pronounce free pardon to them all
And yield to mercy whilst 'tis offer'd you,
And you, base peasants, do ye believe him? Will you needs be
And make the meanest of you earls and dukes?
And he that brings his head unto the King
And could command no more content than I?
And humbly thus, with halters on their necks,
And show'd how well you love your Prince and country.
And Henry, though he be infortunate,
And so, with thanks and pardon to you all,
And with a puissant and a mighty power
And still proclaimeth, as he comes along,
And now is York in arms to second him.
And ask him what's the reason of these arms.
And Somerset, we will commit thee thither
And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?
And sends the poor well pleased from my gate.
And like a thief to come to rob my grounds,
And if mine arm be heaved in the air,
And hang thee o'er my tomb when I am dead.
And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,
And there cut off thy most ungracious head,
And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head:
And now, like Ajax Telamonius,
And let my sovereign, virtuous Henry,
And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,
And will that thou thenceforth attend on us.
And never live but true unto his liege!
And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.
And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.
And with the same to act controlling laws.
And chop away that factious pate of his.
And manacle the berard in their chains,
And such a piece of service will you do,
And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?
And shame thine honourable age with blood?
And in my conscience do repute his Grace
And have no other reason for this wrong
And that I'll write upon thy burgonet,
And tread it under foot with all contempt,
And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear,
And dead men's cries do fill the empty air,
And made a prey for carrion kites and crows
And the premised flames of the last day
And in thy reverence and thy chair-days thus
And beauty, that the tyrant oft reclaims,
And where this breach now in our fortunes made
And, like a gallant in the brow of youth,
And like rich hangings in a homely house,
And it hath pleas'd Him that three times to-day
And more such days as these to us befall!             Exeunt
And this the regal seat. Possess it, York;
And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.
And bashful Henry depos'd, whose cowardice
And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge
And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?
And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;
And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.
And slew your fathers, and with colours spread
And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.
And seiz'd upon their towns and provinces.
And be you silent and attentive too,
And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,
And made him to resign his crown perforce.
And over the chair of state, where now he sits,
And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou liv'st.
And die in bands for this unmanly deed!
And neither by treason nor hostility
And never seen thee, never borne thee son,
And disinherited thine only son.
And giv'n unto the house of York such head  
And creep into it far before thy time?
And yet shalt thou be safe? Such safety finds
And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself,
And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace  
And utter ruin of the house of York.
And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.
And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.
And tell him privily of our intent.
And yet the King not privy to my drift,
And therefore fortify your hold, my lord.
And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.
And thus most humbly I do take my leave.                Exit
And issue forth and bid them battle straight.
And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,
And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder.
And not with such a cruel threat'ning look!
And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,
And till I root out their accursed line
And leave not one alive, I live in hell.  
And when I give occasion of offence
And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade
Another part of the field
And all my followers to the eager foe
And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out.'
And full as oft came Edward to my side
And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!
And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
And I am faint and cannot fly their fury;
And were I strong, I would not shun their fury.
And made an evening at the noontide prick.
And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,
And in thy thought o'errun my former time;
And, if thou canst for blushing, view this face,
And bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice
And ten to one is no impeach of valour.
And made a preachment of your high descent?
And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,
And if thine eyes can water for his death,
And I to make thee mad do mock thee thus.
And this is he was his adopted heir.
And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,
And rob his temples of the diadem,
And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.
And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?
And when the rage allays, the rain begins.
And every drop cries vengeance for his death
And I with tears do wash the blood away.
And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,
And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'
And in thy need such comfort come to thee
And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.
And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.
And takes her farewell of the glorious sun.
And overshine the earth, as this the world.
And stood against them as the hope of Troy
And many strokes, though with a little axe,  
And after many scorns, many foul taunts,
And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,
And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.
And now, to add more measure to your woes,
And very well appointed, as I thought,
And we in them no hope to win the day;
And when came George from Burgundy to England?
And for your brother, he was lately sent
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,
And wrap our bodies in black mourning-gowns,
And therefore comes my brother Montague.
And of their feather many moe proud birds,
And now to London all the crew are gone
And once again bestride our foaming steeds,
And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'
And when thou fail'st- as God forbid the hour!-
And he that throws not up his cap for joy
And craves your company for speedy counsel.  
And harmful pity must be laid aside.
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
And raise his issue like a loving sire:
And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,
And long hereafter say unto his child
And let his manly face, which promiseth
And happy always was it for that son
And would my father had left me no more!
And this soft courage makes your followers faint.
And learn this lesson: Draw thy sword in right.
And in that quarrel use it to the death.
And in the towns, as they do march along,
And hearten those that fight in your defence.
And set thy diadem upon my head,
And ne'er was Agamemmon's brother wrong'd  
And tam'd the King, and made the Dauphin stoop;
And had he match'd according to his state,
And grac'd thy poor sire with his bridal day,
And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.
And we, in pity of the gentle King,
And that thy summer bred us no increase,
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,
And either victory or else a grave!
And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.
And weak we are, and cannot shun pursuit.
And in the very pangs of death he cried,
And look upon, as if the tragedy  
And in this vow do chain my soul to thine!
And ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face
And give sweet passage to my sinful soul.
And give them leave to fly that will not stay,
And call them pillars that will stand to us;
And if we thrive, promise them such rewards
Another part of the field
And this for Rutland; both bound to revenge,
And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;
And here's the heart that triumphs in their death
And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
And so, have at thee!                           [They fight]
Another part of the field
And to conclude: the shepherd's homely curds,
And I, that haply take them from him now,
And I, who at his hands receiv'd my life,
And pardon, father, for I knew not thee.
And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.  
And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war,
And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!
And so obsequious will thy father be,
And Warwick rages like a chafed bull.
And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,
Another part of the field
And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts,
And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.  
And, whereso'er he is, he's surely dead.
And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.
And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.
And rear it in the place your father's stands.
And now to London with triumphant march,
And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen.  
And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread
And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea
And never will I undertake the thing
And George, of Clarence; Warwick, as ourself,
And in this covert will we make our stand,
And, for the time shall not seem tedious,
And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick
And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.  
And Nero will be tainted with remorse
And in conclusion wins the King from her
And men may talk of kings, and why not I?
And we his subjects, sworn in all allegiance,
And you were sworn true subjects unto me;
And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?
And as the air blows it to me again,
And yielding to another when it blows,
And be you kings: command, and I'll obey.
And what God will, that let your King perform;
And what he will, I humbly yield unto.                Exeunt
And come some other time to know our mind.
And what your pleasure is shall satisfy me.
An if what pleases him shall pleasure you.
And she shall be my love, or else my queen.
And that is to enjoy thee for my love.
And yet too good to be your concubine.
And, by God's Mother, I, being but a bachelor,
Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.
And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.
And go we, brothers, to the man that took him
And yet, between my soul's desire and me-
And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,
And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,
And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;
And so I say I'll cut the causes off,
And deck my body in gay ornaments,
And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.
And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,
And am I, then, a man to be belov'd?
And whiles I live t' account this world but hell,
And yet I know not how to get the crown,
And I- like one lost in a thorny wood
And from that torment I will free myself
And cry 'Content!' to that which grieves my heart,
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,  
And frame my face to all occasions.
And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.
And set the murderous Machiavel to school.
And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.
And with dishonour laid me on the ground,
And to my humble seat conform myself.
And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.  
And sit thee by our side. [Seats her by him] Yield not thy neck
And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.
And forc'd to live in Scotland a forlorn;
And if thou fail us, all our hope is done.
And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.
And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!
And then to crave a league of amity,
And lastly to confirm that amity
And thou no more art prince than she is queen.
And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
And not betray thy treason with a blush?
And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,
And better 'twere you troubled him than France.
And, madam, these for you; from whom I know not.
And now, to soothe your forgery and his,
And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,  
And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?
And to repair my honour lost for him
And henceforth I am thy true servitor.
And replant Henry in his former state.
And I forgive and quite forget old faults,
And joy that thou becom'st King Henry's friend.
And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,
And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
And I am ready to put armour on.
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.
And, as occasion serves, this noble Queen
And Prince shall follow with a fresh supply.
And with thy hand thy faith irrevocable
And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.
And thou, Lord Bourbon, our High Admiral,
And I'll be chief to bring him down again;
And you too, Somerset and Montague,
And with their helps only defend ourselves.
And for this once my will shall stand for law.
And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.
And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.
And not be tied unto his brother's will.
And meaner than myself have had like fortune.
And their true sovereign whom they must obey?
And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.
And I am ready to put armour on.'
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'
And haste is needful in this desp'rate case.
And welcome, Somerset. I hold it cowardice
And now what rests but, in night's coverture,
And but attended by a simple guard,
And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,
And seize himself- I say not 'slaughter him,'
And come now to create you Duke of York.
And be true King indeed; thou but the shadow.
And see him seated in the regal throne.               Exeunt
And, as I further have to understand,
And I the rather wean me from despair  
And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross;
And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,
And often but attended with weak guard
And pray that I may repossess the crown.              Exeunt
And turn'd my captive state to liberty,
And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;
And that the people of this blessed land
And now may seem as wise as virtuous
And therefore I yield thee my free consent.
And in devotion spend my latter days,
And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful
And all his lands and goods confiscated.  
And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.
And the Lord Hastings, who attended him
And from the Bishop's huntsmen rescu'd him;
And we shall have more wars befor't be long.
And says that once more I shall interchange
And brought desired help from Burgundy;
And shut the gates for safety of ourselves,
And all those friends that deign to follow me.
And Henry but usurps the diadem.
And now will I be Edward's champion.
And when the morning sun shall raise his car
And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.        Exeunt
And with his troops doth march amain to London;
And many giddy people flock to him.
And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well belov'd,
And all at once, once more a happy farewell.
And, when the lion fawns upon the lamb,
And once again proclaim us King of England.
And swell so much the higher by their ebb.
And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course,
And take the great-grown traitor unawares.
And by thy guess how nigh is Clarence now?
And do expect him here some two hours hence.
And he shall pardon thee these outrages.
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.  
And, weakling, Warwick takes his gift again;
And Henry is my King, Warwick his subject.
And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:
And ten to one you'll meet him in the Tower.
And with the other fling it at thy face,
And thou shalt be the third, if this sword hold.
And set up Lancaster. Why, trowest thou, Warwick,
And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,
And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.
And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,
And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou dar'st.
And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
And kept low shrubs from winter's pow'rful wind.
And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow?
And live we how we can, yet die we must.
And with thy lips keep in my soul a while!
And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,
And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.'
And more he would have said; and more he spoke,
Another part of the field
And we are grac'd with wreaths of victory.
And, as we hear, march on to fight with us.
And blow it to the source from whence it came;
And Somerset, with Oxford, fled to her.
And as we march our strength will be augmented
And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood;
And give more strength to that which hath too much;
And Montague our top-mast; what of him?
And Somerset another goodly mast?
And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I
And what is Edward but a ruthless sea?
And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?
And make him naked foil a man-at-arms.
And make him of the like spirit to himself.
And warriors faint! Why, 'twere perpetual shame.
And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.
Another part of the field
And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?
And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster.
And thou misshapen Dick, I tell ye all
And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.
And men ne'er spend their fury on a child.
And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.
And see our gentle queen how well she fares.
And both preposterous; therefore, not 'good lord.'
And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.
And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,  
And yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.
And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand
And many an old man's sigh, and many a widow's,
And many an orphan's water-standing eye-
And chatt'ring pies in dismal discords sung;
And yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,
And if the rest be true which I have heard,  
And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?  
And so I was, which plainly signified
And this word 'love,' which greybeards call divine,
And not in me! I am myself alone.
And then to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.
And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.  
And two Northumberlands- two braver men
And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.
And made our footstool of security.
And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.
And heave it shall some weight or break my back.
And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.
And cried 'All hail!' when as he meant all harm.
And hither have they sent it for her ransom.
And now what rests but that we spend the time
And follow'd with the general throng and sweat
And if you can be merry then, I'll say
And keep it from the earth.
And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
And let your reason with your choler question
And from a mouth of honour quite cry down
And lose by over-running. Know you not
And proofs as clear as founts in July when
And pav'd with gold, the Emperor thus desir'd,
And break the foresaid peace. Let the King know,
And for his own advantage.
And point by point the treasons of his master
And those of true condition, that your subjects
And lack of other means, in desperate manner
And danger serves among them.
And with a care exempt themselves from fear:
And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?
And though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,
And pardon comes. I shall anon advise you
And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,
And spoil your nobler soul. I say, take heed;
And this man out of prison?
Another spread on's breast, mounting his eyes,
And never see the Louvre.
And understand again like honest men,
An honest country lord, as I am, beaten
And have an hour of hearing; and, by'r Lady,
And thank your lordship. By your leave, sweet ladies.
And to you all, good health!                             [Drinks]
And save me so much talking.
And to what end, is this? Nay, ladies, fear not:
And hither make, as great ambassadors
And pray receive 'em nobly and conduct 'em
An hour of revels with 'em.
And not to kiss you. A health, gentlemen!
And so his peers, upon this evidence,
And something spoke in choler, ill and hasty;
And generally: whoever the King favours
And far enough from court too.
And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.  
And by that name must die; yet, heaven bear witness,
And if I have a conscience, let it sink me
And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,
And as the long divorce of steel falls on me
And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, a God's name.
And if he speak of Buckingham, pray tell him
And when old time Shall lead him to his end,  
And fit it with such furniture as suits
And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun.
And with that blood will make 'em one day groan fort.
And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!  
And must needs say a noble one; which makes me
And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
And when you would say something that is sad,
And merely to revenge him on the Emperor
And with what zeal! For, now he has crack'd the league
And out of all these to restore the King,
And every true heart weeps for 't. All that dare
And with some other business put the King
And thank the holy conclave for their loves.
And, fearing he would rise, he was so virtuous,
And range with humble livers in content
And wear a golden sorrow.
And venture maidenhead for 't; and so would you,
And say I spoke with you.
And leave me out on't. Would I had no being,
And on all sides th' authority allow'd;
And to bestow your pity on me; for
And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,
And process of this time, you can report,
And prove it too against mine honour, aught,
And unmatch'd wit and judgment; Ferdinand,
And of your choice, these reverend fathers-men
And that, without delay, their arguments
And worthily, my falsehood! Yea, as much
And to say so no more.
And to be judg'd by him.
And like her true nobility she has
And thus far clear him. Now, what mov'd me to't,
And press'd in with this caution. First, methought
And doctors learn'd. First, I began in private
And consequence of dread-that I committed
And did entreat your Highness to this course
And kingly dignity, we are contented
And the mountain tops that freeze,
And service to his Majesty and you,
And comforts to your cause.  
And to such men of gravity and learning,
And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends,
And all such false professors! Would you have me-
And all the fellowship I hold now with him
And am I thus rewarded? 'Tis not well, lords.  
And to that woman, when she has done most,
And force them with a constancy, the Cardinal
Anything on him; for he hath a witchcraft
And came to th' eye o' th' King; wherein was read
And hedges his own way. But in this point
And let him cry 'Ha!' louder!
And widow to Prince Arthur.
Anne Bullen! No, I'll no Anne Bullens for him;
And well deserving? Yet I know her for
An heretic, an arch one, Cranmer; one
And is his oracle.
And fix'd on spiritual object, he should still
And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well;
And yet words are no deeds. My father lov'd you:
And, if you may confess it, say withal
And throw it from their soul; though perils did
And stand unshaken yours.
And after, this; and then to breakfast with
And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence,
And from that full meridian of my glory
And no man see me more.
And an that love his follies.
And from this fellow? If we live thus tamely,
And dare us with his cap like larks.
And spotless shall mine innocence arise,
And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;  
And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
And then he falls, as I do. I have ventur'd,
And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
And when I am forgotten, as I shall be,
And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention
And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,
And my integrity to heaven, is all
And, to be short, for not appearance and
And the late marriage made of none effect;
And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.
And more and richer, when he strains that lady;
And sometimes falling ones.
And make 'em reel before 'em. No man living
And with the same full state pac'd back again
And one, already, of the Privy Council.
An old man, broken with the storms of state,
And yet with charity. He was a man
And though he were unsatisfied in getting-
And found the blessedness of being little.
And, to add greater honours to his age  
And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?
And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel
And of an earthly cold! Mark her eyes.
And heartily entreats you take good comfort.
And now I should not lie-but will deserve,
And sure those men are happy that shall have 'em.  
And something over to remember me by.
And able means, we had not parted thus.
And durst commend a secret to your ear
And, let me tell you, it will ne'er be well-
And princely care, foreseeing those fell mischiefs
And we must root him out. From your affairs
And am right sorry to repeat what follows.
And am right glad to catch this good occasion
And corn shall fly asunder; for I know
And woo your own destruction.
And do as I have bid you.
And of a lovely boy. The God of Heaven
An ordinary groom is for such payment.
And at the door too, like a post with packets.
And has done half an hour, to know your pleasures.
And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us,
And, not reform'd, may prove pernicious.
And with no little study, that my teaching
And the strong course of my authority
And freely urge against me.
And by that virtue no man dare accuse you.
And our consent, for better trial of you,
And see him safe i' th' Tower.
And his disciples only envy at-
And think with wagging of your tongue to win me;
And wisdom of my Council; but I find none.
And fair purgation to the world, than malice,
And Lady Marquis Dorset. Will these please you?
And brother-love I do it.  
And that I would not for a cow, God save her!
An army cannot rule 'em.
And here ye lie baiting of bombards, when
And all that shall succeed. Saba was never
And hang their heads with sorrow. Good grows with her;
And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.
And so stand fix'd. Peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,
And like a mountain cedar reach his branches
An aged princess; many days shall see her,
And yet no day without a deed to crown it.
And you, good brethren, I am much beholding;
And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords;
And sleep an act or two; but those, we fear,
And say 'twill do, I know within a while
And put the same into young Arthur's hand,
And sullen presage of your own decay.
An honourable conduct let him have-
And wound her honour with this diffidence.
And were our father, and this son like him-
And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,
And in the meantime sojourn'd at my father's;
And if he were, he came into the world
And if she did play false, the fault was hers;
And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,
And I had his, Sir Robert's his, like him;
And if my legs were two such riding-rods,
And, to his shape, were heir to all this land-
And have is have, however men do catch.
And I am I, howe'er I was begot.
And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
And when my knightly stomach is suffic'd,
And then comes answer like an Absey book:
And so, ere answer knows what question would,
And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
And fits the mounting spirit like myself;
And so am I, whether I smack or no;
And not alone in habit and device,
And so doth yours: your fault was not your folly;
And they shall say when Richard me begot,
And fought the holy wars in Palestine,
And for amends to his posterity,
And to rebuke the usurpation
And coops from other lands her islanders-
And confident from foreign purposes-
And then we shall repent each drop of blood
And stir them up against a mightier task.
An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;
And all th' unsettled humours of the land-
And this his son; England was Geffrey's right,
And this is Geffrey's. In the name of God,
And by whose help I mean to chastise it.
An 'a may catch your hide and you alone.
And out of my dear love I'll give thee more
And with her plague; her sin his injury,
And all for her-a plague upon her!
And ready mounted are they to spit forth
And merciless proceeding by these French
And but for our approach those sleeping stones
And now, instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire,
And let us in-your King, whose labour'd spirits,
And king o'er him and all that he enjoys;
And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,
And with a blessed and unvex'd retire,
And leave your children, wives, and you, in peace.
And stalk in blood to our possession?
And if not that, I bring you witnesses:
And make a monster of you.
And let young Arthur, Duke of Britaine, in,
And victory with little loss doth play
And like a jolly troop of huntsmen come
And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men,
And bear possession of our person here,
And till it be undoubted, we do lock
And stand securely on their battlements
And part your mingled colours once again,
And kiss him with a glorious victory.
And lay this Angiers even with the ground;
And when that we have dash'd them to the ground,
And I shall show you peace and fair-fac'd league;
And she again wants nothing, to name want,
And she a fair divided excellence,
And two such shores to two such streams made one,
And give you entrance; but without this match,
And all that we upon this side the sea-
And quarter'd in her heart-he doth espy
And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town
And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,
And this same bias, this commodity,
And why rail I on this commodity?
And say there is no sin but to be rich;
And being rich, my virtue then shall be
And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,  
And let belief and life encounter so
And with the half-blown rose; but Fortune, O!
And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France
And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.
And leave those woes alone which I alone
And our oppression hath made up this league.
And sooth'st up greatness. What a fool art thou,
And dost thou now fall over to my foes?
And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.  
And from Pope Innocent the legate here,
And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,
And blessed shall he be that doth revolt
And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,
And raise the power of France upon his head,
And by disjoining hands hell lose a soul.
And tell me how you would bestow yourself.
And the conjunction of our inward souls
And even before this truce, but new before,
And shall these hands, so lately purg'd of blood,
And make a riot on the gentle brow
And like. a civil war set'st oath to oath.
And may not be performed by thyself,
And being not done, where doing tends to ill,
And falsehood cures, as fire cools fire
And mak'st an oath the surety for thy truth  
And most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear.
And better conquest never canst thou make
And in their rage, I having hold of both,
And pours down mischief. Austria's head lie there,
And ta'en, I fear.
And, ere our coming, see thou shake the bags
And with advantage means to pay thy love;
And, my good friend, thy voluntary oath
And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs;
And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,
And, by my troth, I think thou lov'st me well.
And wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth tread,
And bloody England into England gone,
And I will kiss thy detestable bones,
And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows,
And ring these fingers with thy household worms,
And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust,
And be a carrion monster like thyself.  
And buss thee as thy wife. Misery's love,
And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
And thou shalt be canoniz'd, Cardinal;  
And teaches me to kill or hang myself.
And will again commit them to their bonds,
And, father Cardinal, I have heard you say
And chase the native beauty from his cheek,
And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
And so he'll die; and, rising so again,
And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste,  
And he that stands upon a slipp'ry place
And call them meteors, prodigies, and signs,
And kiss the lips of unacquainted change,
And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
And, O, what better matter breeds for you  
Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,
And bind the boy which you shall find with me
And so I would be here but that I doubt
And I did never ask it you again;
And with my hand at midnight held your head;
And, like the watchful minutes to the hour,
And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;
And call it cunning. Do, an if you will.
And with hot irons must I burn them out.
And quench his fiery indignation
An if an angel should have come to me
And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,
And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;
Any annoyance in that precious sense!
And would not harm me.
And strew'd repentant ashes on his head.
And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert.
And, like a dog that is compell'd to fight,
And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure
And look'd upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.
And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,
And, in the last repeating, troublesome,
And like a shifted wind unto a sail
And oftentimes excusing of a fault
And more, more strong, when lesser is my fear,
And well shall you perceive how willingly
And I do fearfully believe 'tis done  
And find th' inheritance of this poor child,
And she not hear of it?
And here's a prophet that I brought with me
And on that day at noon whereon he says
And others more, going to seek the grave
And thrust thyself into their companies.
And fly like thought from them to me again.
And be thou he.  
And when they talk of him, they shake their heads,
And whisper one another in the ear;
And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,
Another lean unwash'd artificer
And on the winking of authority
And thou, to be endeared to a king,
And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me.
And didst in signs again parley with sin;
And consequently thy rude hand to act
And you have slander'd nature in my form,
And make them tame to their obedience!
And foul imaginary eyes of blood
And this, so sole and so unmatchable,
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,
And breathing to his breathless excellence
And he, long traded in it, makes it seem
And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread
And it shall be as all the ocean,
And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace;
And follow me with speed. I'll to the King;
And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.                Exeunt
And from his Holiness use all your power
And make fair weather in your blust'ring land.
And wild amazement hurries up and down
An empty casket, where the jewel of life
And fright him there, and make him tremble there?
And grapple with him ere he come so nigh.
And I have made a happy peace with him;
And he hath promis'd to dismiss the powers
And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,  
And find no check? Let us, my liege, to arms.
And keep it safe for our remembrance;
And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.
And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear
And heal the inveterate canker of one wound
And is't not pity, O my grieved friends!
And follow unacquainted colours here?
And grapple thee unto a pagan shore,
And not to spend it so unneighbourly!
And great affections wrestling in thy bosom
And with a great heart heave away this storm;  
And even there, methinks, an angel spake:
And on our actions set the name of right
And tame the savage spirit of wild war,
And be no further harmful than in show.
And brought in matter that should feed this fire;
And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out
And come ye now to tell me John hath made  
And, now it is half-conquer'd, must I back
And such as to my claim are liable,
And shall I now give o'er the yielded set?
And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world
And, as you answer, I do know the scope
And warrant limited unto my tongue.
And will not temporize with my entreaties;
And like an eagle o'er his aery tow'rs
And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,
And so shall you, being beaten. Do but start
And echo with the clamour of thy drum,
And even at hand a drum is ready brac'd
And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder; for at hand-
And send him word by me which way you go.
And will not let me welcome this good news.
And welcome home again discarded faith.  
And I with him, and many moe with me,
And like a bated and retired flood,
And calmly run on in obedience
And happy newness, that intends old right.
And wound our tott'ring colours clearly up,
And your supply, which you have wish'd so long,  
An open place wear Swinstead Abbey
And brought Prince Henry in their company;
And they are all about his Majesty.
And tempt us not to bear above our power!
And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
And none of you will bid the winter come
And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much;
And so ingrateful you deny me that.
And spleen of speed to see your Majesty!
And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
And then all this thou seest is but a clod
And module of confounded royalty.
And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,
And instantly return with me again
And brings from him such offers of our peace
And happily may your sweet self put on
And true subjection everlastingly.
And knows not how to do it but with tears.
And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,
And when you saw his chariot but appear,
And do you now put on your best attire?
And do you now cull out a holiday?
And do you now strew flowers in his way
And drive away the vulgar from the streets;
And keep us all in servile fearfulness.              Exeunt.
And show of love as I was wont to have;
And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
And since you know you cannot see yourself
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus;
And after scandal them, or if you know
And I will look on both indifferently.
And swim to yonder point?" Upon the word,
And bade him follow. So indeed he did.  
And stemming it with hearts of controversy.
And when the fit was on him I did mark
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
And bear the palm alone. Shout.                    Flourish.
And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
And all the rest look like a chidden train:
And therefore are they very dangerous.
And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.
And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
And after this let Caesar seat him sure;
And yesterday the bird of night did sit
And thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open  
And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder
And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.
And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;
And he shall wear his crown by sea and land
And dangers are to me indifferent.
And I will set this foot of mine as far
And I do know by this, they stay for me
And the complexion of the element  
And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,
And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
And that which would appear offense in us,
And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,  
And then, I grant, we put a sting in him
And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
And kill him in the shell.
And the first motion, all the interim is  
And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
And every man hence to his idle bed;
And will not palter? And what other oath
And buy men's voices to commend our deeds.
And in the spirit of men there is no blood.
And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
And for Mark Antony, think not of him,
And that were much he should, for he is given
And the persuasion of his augurers
And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
And I will bring him to the Capitol.
And, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember
And so, good morrow to you every one.
And when I ask'd you what the matter was,
And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot.
And, could it work so much upon your shape
And will he steal out of his wholesome bed
And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
And not my husband's secrets?
And by and by thy bosom shall partake
Any exploit worthy the name of honor.  
And I will strive with things impossible,
And with a heart new-fired I follow you,
And bring me their opinions of success.
And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;
And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
And I do fear them.
And I the elder and more terrible.
And Caesar shall go forth.
And he shall say you are not well today.
And, for thy humor, I will stay at home.
And tell them that I will not come today.  
And these does she apply for warnings and portents
And evils imminent, and on her knee  
And know it now, the Senate have concluded
And reason to my love is liable.
And look where Publius is come to fetch me.
And we like friends will straightway go together.
And as a suitor will I give him this.
Another part of the same street, before the house of Brutus.
And so return to you, and nothing else?
And the wind brings it from the Capitol.
And bring me word what he doth say to thee.
And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.
An humble heart.                                     Kneels.
And turn preordinance and first decree
And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;
And constant do remain to keep him so.
And drawing days out that men stand upon.
And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood
And waving our red weapons o'er our heads,
And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:
And this the bleeding business they have done.
And pity to the general wrong of Rome-
And then we will deliver you the cause
And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.
And am moreover suitor that I may
And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
And show the reason of our Caesar's death.
And that we are contented Caesar shall
And say you do't by our permission,
And dreadful objects so familiar,
And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge,
And bid me say to you by word of mouth-
And part the numbers.
And public reasons shall be rendered
And, for my sake, stay here with Antony.
And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
And Brutus is an honorable man.
And Brutus is an honorable man.
And sure he is an honorable man.
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
And I must pause till it come back to me.
And none so poor to do him reverence.
And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
And, dying, mention it within their wills,
And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,
And let me show you him that made the will.
And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,  
And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony  
And to your heirs forever- common pleasures,
And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
And in this mood will give us anything.
And things unluckily charge my fantasy.
And took his voice who should be prick'd to die  
And though we lay these honors on this man
And having brought our treasure where we will,
And graze in commons.
And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so:
And let us presently go sit in council,
And open perils surest answered.
And bay'd about with many enemies;
And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,
And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?
And when you do them-
And I will give you audience.
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.  
And not for justice? What, shall one of us,
And sell the mighty space of our large honors
And make your bondmen tremble. Must I bouge?
And it shall please me well. For mine own part,
And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring
And here my naked breast; within, a heart
And straight is cold again.
And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
And (her attendants absent) swallow'd fire.
And call in question our necessities.
And by that order of proscription.
And we must take the current when it serves,
And nature must obey necessity,
And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
And we will follow.
Answering before we do demand of them.
And something to be done immediately.
And leave them honeyless.
And very wisely threat before you sting.
And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;
And his opinion. Now I change my mind,
And partly credit things that do presage.
And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites
And whether we shall meet again I know not.
And then the end is known. Come, ho! Away!           Exeunt.
And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
Another part of the field.
And here again, that I may rest assured
And tell me what thou notest about the field.
And where I did begin, there shall I end;
And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,
And when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,
And I will seek for Pindarus the while.        Exit Messala.
And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
And come, young Cato; let us to the field.
Another part of the field.
And mayst be honor'd, being Cato's son.
And see wheer Brutus be alive or dead,
And bring us word unto Octavius' tent
Another part of the field.
And this last night here in Philippi fields.
And no man else hath honor by his death.
And common good to all, made one of them.
And say to all the world, "This was a man!"
And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters
And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
And find I am alone felicitate
And yet not so; since I am sure my love's
And as a stranger to my heart and me
And in thy best consideration check
And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,
And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
And, like a sister, am most loath to call  
And well are worth the want that you have wanted.
And my invention thrive, Edmund the base
And the King gone to-night? subscrib'd his pow'r?
And keep in-a-door,
And thou shalt have more
And I for sorrow sung,
And go the fools among.
And the remainder that shall still depend
And in the most exact regard support
And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!
And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.
And from her derogate body never spring
And be a thwart disnatur'd torment to her.
And cast you, with the waters that you lose,
And such a daughter,
And hold our lives in mercy.- Oswald, I say!
And thereto add such reasons of your own
And hasten your return. [Exit Oswald.] No, no, my lord!
And I have one thing, of a queasy question,
And Regan with him. Have you nothing said
And found- dispatch. The noble Duke my master,
And found him pight to do it, with curst speech  
And thou must make a dullard of the world,
An honest mind and plain- he must speak truth!
An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.  
And put upon him such a deal of man  
And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,
And by the happy hollow of a tree
And with presented nakedness outface
And with this horrible object, from low farms,  
And not send back my messenger.
And meeting here the other messenger,
And follows but for form,
And leave thee in the storm.
And let the wise man fly.
And am fallen out with my more headier will,
And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt
And dotage terms so.
And thou art twice her love.
And let not women's weapons, water drops,
And must needs taste his folly.
And what they may incense him to, being apt
And bids what will take all.
And dare upon the warrant of my note
And from some knowledge and assurance offer
And she will tell you who your fellow is
Another part of the heath.
And turn his sleep to wake.
And make them keep their caves. Since I was man,
And bawds and whores do churches build:
And show the heavens more just.
And her troth plight,
And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!
And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,
And bring you where both fire and food is ready.
And she must not speak
And for one blast of thy minikin mouth
And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet
And follow me, that will to some provision  
And not from one oppos'd.
And quench'd the steeled fires.
And in the end meet the old course of death,
Ang'ring itself and others.- Bless thee, master!
And bring some covering for this naked soul,
And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?
And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear
And of the loyal service of his son
And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out.
And come to deadly use.
And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment  
And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend.
And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
And clamour moisten'd. Then away she started
And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause  
And bring him to our eye. [Exit an Officer.] What can man's
And more convenient is he for my hand
And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!
And yet I know not how conceit may rob
And frustrate his proud will.
And my heart breaks at it.  
And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;
And, like a scurvy politician, seem
And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,
And give the letters which thou find'st about me
And the exchange my brother! Here in the sands
And woes by wrong imaginations lose  
And every measure fail me.
And hold your hands in benediction o'er me.
And, to deal plainly,
And self-reproving. Bring his constant pleasure.
And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.
And machination ceases. Fortune love you!
And I'll appear again.
And hardly shall I carry out my side,
And ask of thee forgiveness. So we'll live,
And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
And take upon 's the mystery of things,
And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes.
And fortune led you well. You have the captives
And turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
And the best quarrels, in the heat, are curs'd
And call itself your brother.  
And I, her husband, contradict your banes.
And read out this.
And from th' extremest upward of thy head
And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,
An unknown opposite. Thou art not vanquish'd,
And more, much more. The time will bring it out.
And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst!
And shall perchance do good; but speak you on;
And top extremity.
And there I left him tranc'd.
And after slew herself.
And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
And desperately are dead.
And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,
And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
And make us heirs of all eternity.
And the huge army of the world's desires-
And one day in a week to touch no food,
And but one meal on every day beside,
And then to sleep but three hours in the night
And not be seen to wink of all the day-
And make a dark night too of half the day-
And stay here in your court for three years' space.
And train our intellects to vain delight.
And give him light that it was blinded by.
And every godfather can give a name.
And though I have for barbarism spoke more
And bide the penance of each three years' day.  
And to the strictest decrees I'll write my name.
And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
And he that breaks them in the least degree
And I will use him for my minstrelsy.
And so to study three years is but short.
And go we, lords, to put in practice that
And fears by pale white shown.
And prodigally gave them all to you.
And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
And much too little of that good I saw
And younger hearings are quite ravished;
And he and his competitors in oath
And sin to break it.
And suddenly resolve me in my suit.         [Giving a paper]
And hold fair friendship with his Majesty.
And have the money by our father lent,
And go well satisfied to France again.
And wrong the reputation of your name,
And, if you prove it, I'll repay it back
An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.
And stay'd the odds by adding four.
And he ended the market.
And in her train there is a gentle lady;
And Rosaline they call her. Ask for her,
And to her white hand see thou do commend  
And I to be a corporal of his field,
And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!  
And never going aright, being a watch,
And, among three, to love the worst of all,
And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!
And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.
And shooting well is then accounted ill;
And, out of question, so it is sometimes:
An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,
And he from forage will incline to play.  
An I cannot, another can.
And his page a t' other side, that handful of wit!
And such barren plants are set before us that we thankful should
And raught not to five weeks when he came to five-score.
And they thy glory through my grief will show.
And wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'er-eye.
And deny himself for Jove,
And mark'd you both, and for you both did blush.
And profound Solomon to tune a jig,
And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,
And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!
And, gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?
And where my liege's? All about the breast.
And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy.
And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.
And therefore is she born to make black fair.
And therefore red that would avoid dispraise
And abstinence engenders maladies.
And, where that you you have vow'd to study, lords,
And study too, the causer of your vow;
And where we are our learning likewise is;
And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
And therefore, finding barren practisers,
And gives to every power a double power,
And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
And plant in tyrants mild humility.
And who can sever love from charity?
And justice always whirls in equal measure.
And so she died. Had she been light, like you,
And so may you; for a light heart lives long.
An if my face were but as fair as yours,
And wait the season, and observe the times,
And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes,
And shape his service wholly to my hests,
And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.
And overheard what you shall overhear-
And ever and anon they made a doubt
Another with his finger and his thumb
And every one his love-feat will advance
And not a man of them shall have the grace,
And then the King will court thee for his dear;
And change you favours too; so shall your loves
And mock for mock is only my intent.
And quite divorce his memory from his part.
And they well mock'd depart away with shame.
And many miles, the Princess bids you tell
And would afford my speechless vizard half.
And trow you what he call'd me?
And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows;
And wonder what they were, and to what end
And their rough carriage so ridiculous,
And utters it again when God doth please.
And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,
And consciences that will not die in debt
And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,  
And I will wish thee never more to dance,
And, to begin, wench- so God help me, law!-
And Lord Berowne, I thank him, is my dear.
And laugh upon the apple of her eye?
And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,
And if these four Worthies in their first show thrive,
And travelling along this coast, I bere am come by chance,
And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France.
And when be was a babe, a child, a shrimp,
And so adieu, sweet Jude! Nay, why dost thou stay?
And often at his very loose decides  
And though the mourning brow of progeny
And by these badges understand the King.
And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,
And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,
And, in our maiden council, rated them
And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine,
And therewithal to win me, if you please,
And I will have you and that fault withal.
And I shall find you empty of that fault,
And then 'twill end.
And lady-smocks all silver-white
And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks;
And maidens bleach their summer smocks;
And Dick the shepherd blows his nail,
And Tom bears logs into the hall,
And milk comes frozen home in pail,
And coughing drowns the parson's saw,
And birds sit brooding in the snow,
And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
An English Doctor
An Old Man
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald-
And Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,  
And fix'd his head upon our battlements.
And fan our people cold.
And with his former title greet Macbeth.
And mounch'd, and mounch'd, and mounch'd. "Give me," quoth I.
And, like a rat without a tail,
And the very ports they blow,
And thrice again, to make up nine.
And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
And say which grain will grow and which will not,
And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?
And pour'd them down before him.
And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
An absolute trust.  
And hold thee to my heart.
And you whose places are the nearest, know
And bind us further to you.
And in his commendations I am fed;
And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
And that which rather thou dost fear to do
And chastise with the valor of my tongue
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
And take my milk for gall, your murthering ministers,
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell  
And thank us for your trouble.
And the late dignities heap'd up to them,
And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him
And shall continue our graces towards him.
And pity, like a naked new-born babe
And falls on the other.
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
And live a coward in thine own esteem,
And, to be more than what you were, you would
And dash'd the brains out had I so sworn as you
And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep-
And yet I would not sleep. Merciful powers,
And such an instrument I was to use.
And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,
And take the present horror from the time,
And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed
And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
And prophesying with accents terrible
And look on death itself! Up, up, and see
And say it is not so.
And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature
And when we have our naked frailties hid,
And question this most bloody piece of work
And meet i' the hall together.
And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,
And yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp.
And guardian of their bones.
And set me up in hope? But hush, no more.
And all thing unbecoming.
And I'll request your presence.
And so I do commend you to their backs.
And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like
And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
And champion me to the utterance! Who's there?
And beggar'd yours forever?
And I will put that business in your bosoms
And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
And something from the palace (always thought
And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
And with thy bloody and invisible hand
And last the hearty welcome.
And play the humble host.
And health on both!
And hath been from his youth. Pray you, keep seat.
And there an end; but now they rise again,
And push us from our stools. This is more strange
And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss.
And all to all.
And dare me to the desert with thy sword.
And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks
And betimes I will, to the weird sisters.
And I, the mistress of your charms,
And, which is worse, all you have done
And at the pit of Acheron
And that distill'd by magic sleights
And you all know security
And the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late,
And hums, as who should say, "You'll rue the time
And everyone shall share i' the gains.
And now about the cauldron sing,
And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live,
And sleep in spite of thunder.
And wears upon his baby brow the round
And top of sovereignty?
And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.
Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more!
And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass
And points at them for his. What, is this so?
And show the best of our delights.
And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear
And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor
And what will you do now? How will you live?
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.
And the rich East to boot.
And here from gracious England have I offer
And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.
And my more-having would be as a sauce
And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father
And sundry blessings hang about his throne
An older and a better soldier none
And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,
And still keep eyes upon her. So good night.
And many unrough youths that even now
And with him pour we, in our country's purge,
And mingle with the English epicures!
And that which should accompany old age,
And with some sweet oblivious antidote
And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
Angus, Lennox, Ross, and Soldiers, marching.
And bear't before him; thereby shall we shadow
And none serve with him but constrained things
And beat them backward home.
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
And then is heard no more. It is a tale
And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.
And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,
And more I beg not.                           Exit. Alarums.
And little is to do.
Another part of the field.
And let the angel whom thou still hast served
And be these juggling fiends no more believed
And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.
And live to be the show and gaze o' the time.
And to be baited with the rabble's curse.  
And thou opposed, being of no woman born,
And damn'd be him that first cries, "Hold, enough!"
And so his knell is knoll'd.
And that I'll spend for him.
And so God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.
And make us even with you. My Thanes and kinsmen,  
And let them work. The nature of our people,
And given his deputation all the organs
And we may soon our satisfaction have
And the new deputy now for the Duke-
And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
And there receive her approbation;
And well she can persuade.
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
And so it is received. Now, pious sir,  
And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
And not the punishment. Therefore, indeed, my father,
And yet my nature never in the fight
And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
And with full line of his authority,
And follows close the rigour of the statute
And make us lose the good we oft might win
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
And let it keep one shape till custom make it
And pull'd the law upon you.
Another thing to fall. I not deny
And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.
And some condemned for a fault alone.
And leave you to the hearing of the cause,
Another room in ANGELO'S house
And you shall well be spar'd.
And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
And most desire should meet the blow of justice;
And not my brother.  
And let go by the actor.
And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.
And you were Isabel! Should it then be thus?
And what a prisoner.  
And you but waste your words.
And He that might the vantage best have took
And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
And so in progress to be hatch'd and born-
And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
And he that suffers. O, it is excellent
And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
And he that got it, sentenc'd- a young man
And you shall be conducted.
And try your penitence, if it be sound
And take the shame with joy.
And I am going with instruction to him.
Anchors on Isabel. Heaven in my mouth,
And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
And dispossessing all my other parts
And nothing of your answer.
And strip myself to death as to a bed
And rather prov'd the sliding of your brother
And credulous to false prints.
And from this testimony of your own sex,
And you tell me that he shall die for't.
And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
And smell of calumny. I have begun,
And now I give my sensual race the rein:  
And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.         Exit
And yet run'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
And that thou oft provok'st; yet grossly fear'st
And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
And Death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
And, seeking death, find life. Let it come on.
And leave you naked.
And six or seven winters more respect
And the poor beetle that we tread upon
And hug it in mine arms.
And blown with restless violence round about
Angelo; if for this night he entreat you to his bed, give him
And perform an old contracting.                    Exit
And those eyes, the break of day,
And to that vineyard is a planched gate
And that I have possess'd him my most stay
And rack thee in their fancies.  
And to transport him in the mind he is
And satisfy the deputy with the visage
And sent according to command; whiles I
And how shall we continue Claudio,
And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
And general honour.
And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter.
And dull to all proceedings. A deflow'red maid!
And by an eminent body that enforc'd
And hold you ever to our special drift;
And tell him where I stay; give the like notice
And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand.
And let the subject see, to make them know
And good supporters are you.
And given me justice, justice, justice, justice.
An hypocrite, a virgin-violator,
And hide the false seems true.
And I did yield to him. But the next morn betimes,
And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on;
And to set on this wretched woman here
And, on my trust, a man that never yet
And all probation, will make up full clear,
And I confess, besides, I am no maid.
And charges him, my lord, with such a time
And did supply thee at thy garden-house
And five years since there was some speech of marriage
And punish them to your height of pleasure.
And he may fetch him.
And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
Angelo? They have confess'd you did.
And put your trial in the villain's mouth
And in the witness of his proper ear,
And hold no longer out.
And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
And you may marvel why I obscur'd myself,
And choke your good to come. For his possessions,
And take her hence in horror.
And, for the most, become much more the better
And must be buried but as an intent
And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.
And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
And squar'st thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd;
And pray thee take this mercy to provide
And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.
And he shall marry her. The nuptial finish'd,
And see our pleasure herein executed.  
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me
And every object that might make me fear
And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,
And see the holy edifice of stone,
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
And, in a word, but even now worth this,
And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought  
And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper;
And other of such vinegar aspect
And you embrace th' occasion to depart.
And mine a sad one.
And let my liver rather heat with wine
And do a wilful stillness entertain,  
And when I ope my lips let no dog bark.'
And from your love I have a warranty
And if it stand, as you yourself still do,
And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
And I am prest unto it; therefore, speak.
And she is fair and, fairer than that word,
And many Jasons come in quest of her.
And, by the near guess of my memory,
And when the work of generation was
And, in the doing of the deed of kind,
And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.
An evil soul producing holy witness  
And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,
And all for use of that which is mine own.
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
And say there is much kindness in the Jew.
And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.
And I will go and purse the ducats straight,
And let us make incision for your love
And hedg'd me by his wit to yield myself
And so may I, blind Fortune leading me,
And die with grieving.
And either not attempt to choose at all,
And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment
And then to scape drowning thrice, and to be in peril of my life
And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;
And lose my hopes.
And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see
And so farewell. I would not have my father
And better in my mind not undertook.
And whiter than the paper it writ on  
And never dare misfortune cross her foot,
And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out-
And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife,
And I should be obscur'd.
And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.
And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,
And true she is, as she hath prov'd herself;
And therefore, like herself, wise, fair, and true,
And weigh thy value with an even hand.
And yet to be afeard of my deserving
And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.
And jewels- two stones, two rich and precious stones,
And wish'd in silence that it were not his.
And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,
And even there, his eye being big with tears,
And with affection wondrous sensible
And quicken his embraced heaviness
And comes to his election presently.
And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.  
And well said too; for who shall go about
And instantly unlock my fortunes here.
And of opposed natures.
Antonio have had any loss at sea or no?  
And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought-
And so all yours. O! these naughty times
And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,
And wat'ry death-bed for him. He may win;
And what is music then? Then music is
And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,
And these assume but valour's excrement
And you shall see 'tis purchas'd by the weight,
And here choose I. Joy be the consequence!
And shudd'ring fear, and green-ey'd jealousy!
And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look how far
And hold your fortune for your bliss,
And claim her with a loving kiss.'
And be my vantage to exclaim on you.
And there is such confusion in my powers
And, when your honours mean to solemnize
And so did mine too, as the matter falls;
And swearing till my very roof was dry
And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio
And I must freely have the half of anything
And then I told you true. And yet, dear lady,
And every word in it a gaping wound
And not one vessel scape the dreadful touch
And doth impeach the freedom of the state,  
And then away to Venice to your friend;
And there we will abide. I do desire you
And will acknowledge you and Jessica
And use thou all th' endeavour of a man
And look what notes and garments he doth give thee,
And wear my dagger with the braver grace,
And speak between the change of man and boy
And wish for all that, that I had not kill'd them.
And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,  
An army of good words; and I do know
And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,
And if on earth he do not merit it,
And on the wager lay two earthly women,
And Portia one, there must be something else
And that no lawful means can carry me
And where thou now exacts the penalty,
And pluck commiseration of his state
And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
And I be pleas'd to give ten thousand ducats
And others, when the bagpipe sings i' th' nose,
And bid the main flood bate his usual height;  
And for thy life let justice be accus'd.
And, whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam,
And here, I take it, is the doctor come.
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
And curb this cruel devil of his will.
And many an error, by the same example,
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
An age of poverty; from which ling'ring penance
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
And he repents not that he pays your debt;
And let the Christian go.
And the offender's life lies in the mercy
And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
And I will sign it.
And it is meet I presently set forth.
Antonio, gratify this gentleman,
And I, delivering you, am satisfied,
And therein do account myself well paid.
And you in love shall not deny me this.
And now, methinks, I have a mind to it.
And find it out by proclamation;
And, when she put it on, she made me vow
And if your wife be not a mad woman,
And know how well I have deserv'd this ring,
And in the morning early will we both
And let him sign it; we'll away tonight,
And be a day before our husbands home.
And so, I pray you, tell him. Furthermore,
And they did make no noise- in such a night,
And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,
And saw the lion's shadow ere himself,
And ran dismayed away.
And with an unthrift love did run from Venice
And ne'er a true one.
And ceremoniously let us prepare
And yet no matter- why should we go in?
And bring your music forth into the air.       Exit STEPHANO
And draw her home with music.                        [Music]
And his affections dark as Erebus.
And would not be awak'd.                      [Music ceases]
And never be Bassanio so for me;
And that it should lie with you in your grave;
And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.
And swear I lost the ring defending it.
And neither man nor master would take aught
And would conceive for what I gave the ring,
And how unwillingly I left the ring,
And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him,
And suffer'd him to go displeas'd away-
And that which you did swear to keep for me,
And in the hearing of these many friends
And there's an oath of credit.
And bid him keep it better than the other.
And even but now return'd; I have not yet
And I have better news in store for you
And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
And charge us there upon inter'gatories,
And we will answer all things faithfully.
And by my side wear steel? Then Lucifer take all!
And high and low beguiles the rich and poor;
And his soft couch defile.
And down, down, adown-a, etc.
Anne's mind-that's neither here nor there.
Anne's mind as well as another does. Out upon 't, what
And a thousand fragrant posies.
And a thousand vagram posies.
And that, my state being gall'd with my expense,
And tells me 'tis a thing impossible
And 'tis the very riches of thyself
And not retire. Let me have your good will.
And bowl'd to death with turnips.  
And as I find her, so am I affected;
And let us two devise to bring him thither.
And there he blasts the tree, and takes the cattle,
And makes milch-kine yield blood, and shakes a chain
And in this shape. When you have brought him thither,
And three or four more of their growth, we'll dress
And rattles in their hands; upon a sudden,
And fairy-like, to pinch the unclean knight;
And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,
And burn him with their tapers.
And mock him home to Windsor.
And marry her at Eton.-Go, send to Falstaff straight.
And tricking for our fairies.
And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.
And he my husband best of all affects.
Anne Page: to know if it were my master's fortune to
And so they shall be both bestowed. I have suffer'd more
And, as I am a gentleman, I'll give the
And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed
And at the dean'ry, where a priest attends,
And in that habit, when Slender sees his time  
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,
And here it rests-that you'll procure the vicar
And in the lawful name of marrying,
Another part of the Park
And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing,
And 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' write  
And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,
And turn him to no pain; but if he start,
And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.
And this deceit loses the name of craft,
And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;
Another moon; but, O, methinks, how slow
And then the moon, like to a silver bow
And won thy love doing thee injuries;
And interchang'd love-tokens with my child;
And stol'n the impression of her fantasy  
And what is mine my love shall render him;
And she is mine; and all my right of her
And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
And come, Egeus; you shall go with me;
And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
And she respects me as her only son.
And to that place the sharp Athenian law
And in the wood, a league without the town,
And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage Queen,
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind.
And therefore is Love said to be a child,
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
And shivering shocks
And Phibbus' car
And make and mar
And I serve the Fairy Queen,
And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
And jealous Oberon would have the child
And now they never meet in grove or green,
And bootless make the breathless housewife churn,
And sometime make the drink to bear no barm,
And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl
And, when she drinks, against her lips I bob,
And on her withered dewlap pour the ale.
And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;
And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,  
And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear
And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
And make him with fair Aegles break his faith,
And never, since the middle summer's spring,
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green,
And thorough this distemperature we see
And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
And this same progeny of evils comes
And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,
And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,
And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
And for her sake do I rear up her boy;
And for her sake I will not part with him.
And see our moonlight revels, go with us;
And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
And certain stars shot madly from their spheres
And loos'd his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
And the imperial vot'ress passed on,
And maidens call it Love-in-idleness.  
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes;
And ere I take this charm from off her sight,
And I will overhear their conference.  
And here am I, and wood within this wood,
And I shall have no power to follow you.
And yet a place of high respect with me,
And the ill counsel of a desert place,
And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,
And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,
And make her full of hateful fantasies.
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
Another part of the wood
And, to speak troth, I have forgot our way;
And tarry for the comfort of the day.
And then end life when I end loyalty!
And here the maiden, sleeping sound,
And reason says you are the worthier maid.
And touching now the point of human skill,
And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook  
And never mayst thou come Lysander near!
And, all my powers, address your love and might
And you sat smiling at his cruel prey.
An actor too perhaps, if I see cause.
And by and by I will to thee appear.                    Exit
And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
And dares not answer nay-
And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me,  
And yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company
And I do love thee; therefore, go with me.
And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,
And sing, while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs,
And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,
And pluck the wings from painted butterflies,
And when she weeps, weeps every little flower;
Another part of the wood
An ass's nole I fixed on his head.
Anon his Thisby must be answered,
And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
And at our stamp here, o'er and o'er one falls;
And left sweet Pyramus translated there;
And the Athenian woman by his side;
And kill me too.
And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!
An adder did it; for with doubler tongue  
And from thy hated presence part I so;
And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight.
And Helena of Athens look thou find;
And the youth mistook by me
And those things do best please me
And now both rivals, to mock Helena.
And here, with all good will, with all my heart,
And yours of Helena to me bequeath,  
And now to Helen is it home return'd,
And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
And made your other love, Demetrius,
And tender me, forsooth, affection,
And never did desire to see thee more.
And stol'n my love's heart from him?
And with her personage, her tall personage,
And are you grown so high in his esteem
And now, so you will let me quiet go,  
And follow you no further. Let me go.
And, though she be but little, she is fierce.
And so far blameless proves my enterprise
And so far am I glad it so did sort,
And lead these testy rivals so astray
And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;
And from each other look thou lead them thus,
And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend
And then I will her charmed eye release
And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger,
And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.
And, like a forester, the groves may tread
And wilt not come? Come, recreant, come, thou child;
And here will rest me. [Lies down] Come, thou gentle day.
And dar'st not stand, nor look me in the face.
And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye,
And the country proverb known,
And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,
And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.
And that same dew which sometime on the buds  
And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,
And now I have the boy, I will undo
And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp
And think no more of this night's accidents
And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
And bless it to all fair prosperity.  
And since we have the vaward of the day,
And mark the musical confusion
And this Lysander, this Demetrius is,
And now I do bethink me, so it is-
And I in fury hither followed them,
And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
And will for evermore be true to it.
And, for the morning now is something worn,
And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,
And by the way let us recount our dreams.             Exeunt  
And as imagination bodies forth
And all their minds transfigur'd so together,
And grows to something of great constancy,
And his love Thisby; very tragical mirth.'
And tragical, my noble lord, it is;
And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories
And it is nothing, nothing in the world;
And duty in his service perishing.
And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
And, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,
And in the modesty of fearful duty
And through Walls chink, poor souls, they are content
And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;
Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain;
And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
And such a wall as I would have you think  
And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,
And like Limander am I trusty still.
And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.           Exit WALL
And farewell, friends;
And the wolf behowls the moon;  
And we fairies, that do run
And this ditty, after me,
And the issue there create
And the blots of Nature's hand
And each several chamber bless,
And the owner of it blest
And this weak and idle theme,
And, as I am an honest Puck,
And Robin shall restore amends.                Exit
Antonio, an old man, his brother.
An orchard before Leonato's house.
And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
Any hard lesson that may do thee good.
And tire the hearer with a book of words.
And I will break with her and with her father,
And thou shalt have her. Wast not to this end
And I will fit thee with the remedy.
And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,
And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart
And take her hearing prisoner with the force
And strong encounter of my amorous tale.
And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.
Ant. He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell you strange
Ant. As the event stamps them; but they have a good cover, they
Ant. A good sharp fellow. I will send for him, and question him
Another room in Leonato's house.]
Ant. I saw him not.
Ant. In faith, she's too curst.
Ant. [to Hero] Well, niece, I trust you will be rul'd by your
Answer, clerk.
Ant. At a word, I am not.
Ant. To tell you true, I counterfeit him.
Ant. At a word, I am not.
And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch
And be you blithe and bonny,
And bid her steal into the pleached bower,
And greedily devour the treacherous bait.
And never to let Beatrice know of it.
And therefore certainly it were not good
And never gives to truth and virtue that
And counsel him to fight against his passion.
And truly, I'll devise some honest slanders
And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,
And made defeat of her virginity--
And so extenuate the forehand sin.
And by that fatherly and kindly power
And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,
And never shall it more be gracious.
And mine that I was proud on--mine so much
And salt too little which may season give
And given way unto this course of fortune,
And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire
And if their wisdoms be misled in this,
And let my counsel sway you in this case.
And publish it that she is dead indeed;
And on your family's old monument
And every lovely organ of her life
And wish he had not so accused her--
And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,
And though you know my inwardness and love
Ant. If you go on thus, you will kill yourself,
And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief
And bid him speak to me of patience.
And let it answer every strain for strain,
And I of him will gather patience.
Ant. Therein do men from children nothing differ.
And made a push at chance and sufferance.
Ant. Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself.
And that shall Claudio know; so shall the Prince,
And all of them that thus dishonour her.
Ant. Here comes the Prince and Claudio hastily.
Ant. If he could right himself with quarrelling,  
And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,
And she lied buried with her ancestors-  
And. He shall kill two of us, and men indeed
Ant. Content yourself. God knows I lov'd my niece,  
And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,
Ant. Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,
And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,
And speak off half a dozen dang'rous words,
And this is all.
Ant. Come, 'tis no matter.
Ant. And shall, or some of us will smart for it.
And fled he is upon this villany.
And yet, to satisfy this good old man,
And sing it to her bones--sing it to-night.
And since you could not be my son-in-law,
And she alone is heir to both of us.
And so dies my revenge.
Ant. Farewell, my lords. We look for you to-morrow.
And so I pray thee call Beatrice. I give thee the bucklers.
And knows me, and knows me,
And then to Leonato's we will go.
Ant. Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.
And when I send for you, come hither mask'd.
And give her to young Claudio.
Ant. Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.
And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,
And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow
And got a calf in that same noble feat  
Ant. This same is she, and I do give you her.
And when you lov'd you were my other husband.
And surely as I live, I am a maid.
And to the chapel let us presently.
And brought with armed men back to Messina.
And, in conclusion,
And what was he?
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
And I- God bless the mark!- his Moorship's ancient.
And not by old gradation, where each second  
And throwing but shows of service on their lords
And such a one do I profess myself.
And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,
Another of his fathom they have none
And there will I be with him. So farewell.                  Exit.
And what's to come of my despised time
And raise some special officers of night.
Another street.
And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
And hath in his effect a voice potential
And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,
And many of the consuls, raised and met,
And go with you.                                            Exit.
And let ourselves again but understand
And prays you to believe him.
And it is still itself.
And you of her, the bloody book of law
And little blest with the soft phrase of peace;
And little of this great world can I speak,
And therefore little shall I grace my cause
And let her speak of me before her father.
And till she come, as truly as to heaven
And she in mine.
And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
And portance in my travels' history;
And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
And often did beguile her of her tears
And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
And I loved her that she did pity them.
And so much duty as my mother show'd
And let me find a charter in your voice
And to his honors and his valiant parts
And I a heavy interim shall support
And heaven defend your good souls, that you think
And all indign and base adversities
And speed must answer't: you must hence tonight.
And he shall our commission bring to you,
And bring them after in the best advantage.
And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets
And will as tenderly be led by the nose
And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole.
And is in full commission here for Cyprus.
And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted
An indistinct regard.
And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.
And in the essential vesture of creation
And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,
And bring all Cyprus comfort.
And chides with thinking.  
And thus she is deliver'd.
And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas
And this, and this, the greatest discords be          Kisses her.
And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona
And nothing can or shall content my soul
And practicing upon his peace and quiet
And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,
And let me the canakin clink.
And thou art but of low degree.
And give direction. And do but see his vice;
And looks not on his evils. Is not this true?
Any beginning to this peevish odds;
And would in action glorious I had lost
And spend your rich opinion for the name
And to defend ourselves it be a sin
And passion, having my best judgement collied,
And he that is approved in this offense,
And Cassio following him with determined sword,
And Cassio high in oath, which till tonight
And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
And by how much she strives to do him good,
And out of her own goodness make the net
And wit depends on dilatory time.
And thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd Cassio.
And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor
And she speaks for you stoutly. The Moor replies
And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom
And needs no other suitor but his likings
And by him do my duties to the Senate.
And yet his trespass, in our common reason-
And fearful to be granted.
And when I told thee he was of my counsel
And didst contract and purse thy brow together,
And for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty
And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,
And makes me poor indeed.
And on the proof, there is no more but this-
And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,
And happily repent.
And hold her free, I do beseech your honor.
And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
And have not those soft parts of conversation
And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
And live upon the vapor of a dungeon,
And give't Iago. What he will do with it
And, to the advantage, I being here took't up.
And let him find it. Trifles light as air
And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
And loses that it works for.
And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,
And to obey shall be in me remorse,
And will upon the instant put thee to't:
And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,
And it was dyed in mummy which the skillful
And, lo, the happiness! Go and importune her.
And shut myself up in some other course
And stood within the blank of his displeasure
And certainly in strange unquietness.
And, like the devil, from his very arm
And he's indicted falsely.
And no conception nor no jealous toy
And seek to effect it to my uttermost.
And think it no addition, nor my wish,
And say if I shall see you soon at night.
An hour or more, not meaning any harm?
And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,
And many a civil monster.
And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know,
And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.
And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy;
And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,
And nothing of a man.
And his unbookish jealousy must construe
An unkind breech; but you shall make all well.
And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;
And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,
And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt!
And new create this fault?
And his own courses will denote him so  
And mark how he continues.
And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.
An instrument of this your calling back,
And will not hear it. What committed?
And keep the gate of hell!
And call thy husband hither.
And put in every honest hand a whip
And made you to suspect me with the Moor.  
And ever will, though he do shake me off
And his unkindness may defeat my life,
And he does chide with you.
Another room in the castle.
And bade me to dismiss you.
And did forsake her. She had a song of "willow";
An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,
And she died singing it. That song tonight
And sing it like poor Barbary. Prithee, dispatch.
And pour our treasures into foreign laps,
And have their palates both for sweet and sour,
And fix most firm thy resolution.
And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons.
And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
And your unblest fate hies. Strumpet, I come!
And cannot make away.
And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd!
And smooth as monumental alabaster.
And love thee after. One more, and this the last;
And makest me call what I intend to do
And makes men mad.
And Cassio kill'd?
And sweet revenge grows harsh.
And you the blacker devil!
An honest man he is, and hates the slime
And fall to reprobation.
And she did gratify his amorous works
And I did give't my husband.
And die in music. [Sings.] "Willow, willow, willow."
And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
And he retires. Where should Othello go?
And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl?
An honorable murtherer, if you will,
And here another. The one of them imports
And he himself confess'd but even now
And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,  
And say besides, that in Aleppo once,  
And smote him, thus.                               Stabs himself.
And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,
And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear  
And free from other misbegotten hate,  
And mark my greeting well; for what I speak
And wish-so please my sovereign-ere I move,
And let him be no kinsman to my liege,
And meet him, were I tied to run afoot
And lay aside my high blood's royalty,
And when I mount, alive may I not light
And consequently, like a traitor coward,
And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
And interchangeably hurl down my gage
And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,
And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
An angry arm against His minister.
And throw the rider headlong in the lists,
And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms;
And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,
And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!
And formally, according to our law,
And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!
And bow my knee before his Majesty;  
And loving farewell of our several friends.
And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.
And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,
And furbish new the name of John o' Gaunt,
And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,
And dares him to set forward to the fight.
And both return back to their chairs again.
And list what with our council we have done.
And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
And for we think the eagle-winged pride
And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,
And make us wade even in our kindred's blood-
And those his golden beams to you here lent
And all unlook'd for from your Highness' mouth.
And now my tongue's use is to me no more
And dull, unfeeling, barren ignorance
And I from heaven banish'd as from hence!
And all too soon, I fear, the King shall rue.
And blindfold death not let me see my son.
And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;
And in the sentence my own life destroy'd.  
And not the King exil'd thee; or suppose
And thou art flying to a fresher clime.
And, for my heart disdained that my tongue
And added years to his short banishment,
And patient underbearing of his fortune,
And had the tribute of his supple knee,
And he our subjects' next degree in hope.  
And, for our coffers, with too great a court
And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,
And send them after to supply our wants;
And thus expiring do foretell of him:
And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?
And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt.
And thou, too careless patient as thou art,
And yet, incaged in so small a verge,
And thou-
And thy unkindness be like crooked age,
And for these great affairs do ask some charge,
And not against his friends. His noble hand
And prick my tender patience to those thoughts
And we create, in absence of ourself,
And quite lost their hearts; the nobles hath he find
And yet we strike not, but securely perish.
And unavoided is the danger now
And shortly mean to touch our northern shore.
And make high majesty look like itself,
And entertain a cheerful disposition.
And driven into despair an enemy's hope
And with uplifted arms is safe arriv'd
And all the rest revolted faction traitors?
And all the household servants fled with him
And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir.
And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,
And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side.
And bring away the armour that is there.
And duty bids defend; t'other again
And meet me presently at Berkeley.
And everything is left at six and seven.
And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,
And hope to joy is little less in joy
And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover  
And as my fortune ripens with thy love,
And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour-
And I am come to seek that name in England;
And I must find that title in your tongue
And fright our native peace with self-borne arms.
And ostentation of despised arms?
And in my loyal bosom lies his power.
And minister correction to thy fault!
And, noble uncle, I beseech your Grace
And yet my letters patents give me leave.
And these and all are all amiss employ'd.
And I challenge law-attorneys are denied me;
And therefore personally I lay my claim
And labour'd all I could to do him right;
And you that do abet him in this kind
And let him never see joy that breaks that oath!
And there repose you for this night.
And hardly kept our countrymen together,
And yet we hear no tidings from the King;
And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven;
And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;
And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.               Exit
And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks
And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,
And plague injustice with the pains of hell.
And do thee favours with my royal hands.
And heavy-gaited toads, lie in their way,
And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,
And not neglected; else, if heaven would,
And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,
And darts his light through every guilty hole,
And bids me speak of nothing but despair.
And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!
And, till so much blood thither come again,
And what loss is it to be rid of care?
And all goes worse than I have power to tell.
And lie full low, grav'd in the hollow ground.
And yet not so-for what can we bequeath
And nothing can we can our own but death
And that small model of the barren earth
And tell sad stories of the death of kings:
And so your follies fight against yourself.
And fight and die is death destroying death,
And learn to make a body of a limb.
An easy task it is to win our own.
And all your northern castles yielded up,
And all your southern gentlemen in arms
And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,
And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
And lands restor'd again be freely granted;
And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
And if we be, how dare thy joints forget
And though you think that all, as you have done,
And we are barren and bereft of friends,  
And threat the glory of my precious crown.
And by the honourable tomb he swears
And by the royalties of both your bloods,
And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,
And by the worth and honour of himself,
And as I am a gentleman I credit him.
And all the number of his fair demands
And my large kingdom for a little grave,
And buried once, why not upon my head?
And make a dearth in this revolting land.
And make some pretty match with shedding tears?
And show fair duty to his Majesty.   [He kneels down]
And that my fortune runs against the bias.
And what I want it boots not to complain.
And never borrow any tear of thee.
And some few vanities that make him light;
And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.
And am I last that knows it? O, thou thinkest
And will maintain what thou hast said is false
And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,
And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,
And never brandish more revengeful steel
And spur thee on with fun as many lies  
And you can witness with me this is true.
And spit upon him whilst I say he lies,
And lies, and lies. There is my bond of faith,
And, though mine enemy, restor'd again
And, toil'd with works of war, retir'd himself
And his pure soul unto his captain, Christ,
And long live Henry, fourth of that name!
And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?
And shall the figure of God's majesty,
Anointed, crowned, planted many years,
And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,  
And if you crown him, let me prophesy-
And future ages groan for this foul act;
And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
And little look'd for at your helping hands.
And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.
And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,
And thou with all pleas'd, that hast an achiev'd.
And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit.
And send him many years of sunshine days!
And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,
And water cannot wash away your sin.
And yet salt water blinds them not so much
And know not now what name to call myself!
An if my word be sterling yet in England,
And made no deeper wounds? O flatt'ring glass,
And these external manner of laments  
And then be gone and trouble you no more.
And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.
And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,
And cloister thee in some religious house.
And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage
And fawn on rage with base humility,
And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs
And send the hearers weeping to their beds;
And in compassion weep the fire out;
And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,
And, madam, there is order ta'en for you:
And he shall think that thou, which knowest the way
And then betwixt me and my married wife.
And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.
And piece the way out with a heavy heart.
And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.
And barbarism itself have pitied him.  
And madam, you must call him Rudand now.
And lasting fealty to the new-made king.
And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age
And rob me of a happy mother's name?
And interchangeably set down their hands
And that he is a bastard, not thy son.
And yet I love him.
And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.
And never will I rise up from the ground  
And beat our watch and rob our passengers,
And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford.
And from the common'st creature pluck a glove  
And wear it as a favour; and with that
And thy abundant goodness shall excuse
And he shall spend mine honour with his shame,
And now chang'd to 'The Beggar and the King.'
And never see day that the happy sees
An if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,
And urg'd it twice together, did he not?
And, for because the world is populous
And here is not a creature but myself,
And these same thoughts people this little world,
And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.
And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
And none contented. Sometimes am I king;
And so I am. Then crushing penury
And straight am nothing. But whate'er I be,
And here have I the daintiness of ear
And yet I bear a burden like an ass,
And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.
And never show thy head by day nor light.  
And put on sullen black incontinent.
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds
And that so lamely and unfashionable
And descant on mine own deformity.
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
And if King Edward be as true and just
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G,
And says a wizard told him that by G
And, for my name of George begins with G,
Antony Woodville, her brother there,
And that the Queen's kindred are made gentlefolks.
And whatsoe'er you will employ me in-
And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
And his physicians fear him mightily.
And overmuch consum'd his royal person!
And, if I fail not in my deep intent,
And leave the world for me to bustle in!
And that be heir to his unhappiness!
And still as you are weary of this weight
And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
And fall something into a slower method-
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,  
And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
And if thy poor devoted servant may
And presently repair to Crosby House;
And wet his grave with my repentant tears-
And I no friends to back my suit at all
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
And will she yet abase her eyes on me,
And made her widow to a woeful bed?
And entertain a score or two of tailors
And then return lamenting to my love.
And cheer his Grace with quick and merry eyes.
And loves not me, be you, good lord, assur'd
And between them and my Lord Chamberlain;
And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
And not provok'd by any suitor else-
An earnest advocate to plead for him.
And then deny her aiding hand therein,
And lay those honours on your high desert.
And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.
And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
And for his meed, poor lord, he is mewed up.
And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance.
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
And then to dry them gav'st the Duke a clout
And God, not we, hath plagu'd thy bloody deed.
And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!
And turn you all your hatred now on me?
And see another, as I see thee now,
And, after many length'ned hours of grief,
And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
And then hurl down their indignation
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
And if they fall they dash themselves to pieces.
And dallies with the wind, and scorns the sun.
And shamefully my hopes by you are butcher'd.
And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage!
And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
And all their ministers attend on him.
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
And he to yours, and all of you to God's!               Exit
And for your Grace, and you, my gracious lords.
And tell them 'tis the Queen and her allies  
And thus I clothe my naked villainy
And seem a saint when most I play the devil.
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
And in my company my brother Gloucester,
And cited up a thousand heavy times,
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatt'red by.
And so he vanish'd. Then came wand'ring by
An outward honour for an inward toil;
And for unfelt imaginations
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
And charg'd us from his soul to love each other,
And hugg'd me in his arms, and swore with sobs
And are you yet to your own souls so blind
And when I have my meed, I will away;
And more at peace my soul shall part to heaven,
And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.
And what you do, do it unfeignedly.
And make me happy in your unity.  
And most assured that he is a friend,
And, princely peers, a happy time of day!
And that a winged Mercury did bear;
And yet go current from suspicion!
And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave?
And yet his punishment was bitter death.
And said 'Dear Brother, live, and be a king'?
And I, unjustly too, must grant it you.        [DERBY rises]
And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'?
And call us orphans, wretches, castaways,
And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
And pitied me, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
And he would love me dearly as a child.
And with a virtuous vizor hide deep vice!
And to myself become an enemy.
And liv'd with looking on his images;  
And I for comfort have but one false glass,
And hast the comfort of thy children left;
And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble hands-
And I will pamper it with lamentation.
And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.
And may direct his course as please himself,
And the compact is firm and true in me.
And, in his full and ripened years, himself,
And the Queen's sons and brothers haught and proud;
And were they to be rul'd, and not to rule,
And at Northampton they do rest to-night;
And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
And often up and down my sons were toss'd
And being seated, and domestic broils
And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen,
And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.
Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate
And those who have the wit to claim the place.
And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.
And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.
And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings
And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
And give us notice of his inclination;
And bid my lord, for joy of this good news,
And, look when I am King, claim thou of me
And that may be determin'd at the one  
And with all speed post with him toward the north
And at the other is my good friend Catesby;
And for his dreams, I wonder he's so simple
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
And we will both together to the Tower,
And I believe will never stand upright
And thereupon he sends you this good news,
And never in my days, I do protest,
And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
And I in better state than e'er I was.
And for more slander to thy dismal seat,
And for my sister, and her princely sons,
And in the Duke's behalf I'll give my voice,
And finds the testy gentleman so hot
And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
And I did scorn it and disdain to fly.
And started when he look'd upon the Tower,
And I myself secure in grace and favour.
And then again begin, and stop again,
And both are ready in their offices
And your good Graces both have well proceeded  
And do not doubt, right noble Princes both,
And so, my good Lord Mayor, we bid farewell.
And bestial appetite in change of lust,
And, by true computation of the time,
And to give order that no manner person
And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
And yet within these five hours Hastings liv'd,
And his contract by deputy in France;
And his enforcement of the city wives;
And his resemblance, being not like the Duke.
And when mine oratory drew toward end
And ask'd the Mayor what meant this wilfull silence.
And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'  
And thus I took the vantage of those few-
And even here brake off and came away.
And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
And stand between two churchmen, good my lord;
And be not easily won to our requests.
And in no worldly suits would he be mov'd,
And so once more return and tell his Grace.
And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,
And pardon us the interruption
And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
And almost should'red in the swallowing gulf
And kingly government of this your land-
And by their vehement instigation,  
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last-
And that my path were even to the crown,
And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
And much I need to help you, were there need.
And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
And afterward by substitute betroth'd
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
And egally indeed to all estates-
And in this resolution here we leave you.  
And so, most joyfully, we take our leave.
And in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
And take thy office from thee on my peril.  
And I'll salute your Grace of York as mother
And reverend looker-on of two fair queens.
And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell.
And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
And die ere men can say 'God save the Queen!'
And that dear saint which then I weeping follow'd-
And when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
And be thy wife, if any be so mad,
And prov'd the subject of mine own soul's curse,  
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.
And each hour's joy wreck'd with a week of teen.
And thy assistance, is King Richard seated.
And I would have it suddenly perform'd.
And unrespective boys; none are for me  
And will, no doubt, tempt him to anything.
And stops he now for breath? Well, be it so.
And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.
And I will love thee and prefer thee for it.
And call'd it Rugemount, at which name I started,
And in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
And here he comes. All health, my sovereign lord!
And be inheritor of thy desire.
And Anne my wife hath bid this world good night.
And by that knot looks proudly on the crown,
And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,  
And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
And will to France, hoping the consequence
And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,  
And hear your mother's lamentation.
And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
And let my griefs frown on the upper hand.
And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!
And now I cloy me with beholding it.
And the beholders of this frantic play,
And send them thither. But at hand, at hand,
And left thee but a very prey to time,
And leave the burden of it all on thee.
And teach me how to curse mine enemies!
And he that slew them fouler than he is.
And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers?
And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?
And never more behold thy face again.
And there the little souls of Edward's children
And promise them success and victory.
And therefore level not to hit their lives.
And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty,  
And I, in such a desp'rate bay of death,
And dangerous success of bloody wars,
And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.
And do intend to make her Queen of England.
And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal.
And not be Richard that hath done all this.
And by that loss your daughter is made Queen.  
And all the ruins of distressful times
And when this arm of mine hath chastised
And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
And she shall be sole victoress, Caesar's Caesar.
And both the Princes had been breathing here,
And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
And you shall understand from me her mind.  
And there they hull, expecting but the aid
And meet me suddenly at Salisbury.
And who is England's King but great York's heir?
And every hour more competitors
And he himself wand'red away alone,
And Rice ap Thomas, with a valiant crew;
And many other of great name and worth;
And towards London do they bend their power,  
And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
And here receive we from our father Stanley
And by the bright tract of his fiery car
And part in just proportion our small power.
And you, Sir Walter Herbert-stay with me.
And by the second hour in the morning
And give him from me this most needful note.
And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!
And all my armour laid into my tent?
And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.
And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms;
And ample interchange of sweet discourse
And fall thy edgeless sword. Despair and die!
And in a bloody battle end thy days!  
And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death!
Anne thy wife
And fall thy edgeless sword. Despair and die.
And die in terror of thy guiltiness!
And Richard falls in height of all his pride.
And every tongue brings in a several tale,
And every tale condemns me for a villain.
And if I die no soul will pity me:
And wherefore should they, since that I myself
And slaughtered those that were the means to help him;
And thus my battle shall be ordered:
And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,
And not these bastard Britaines, whom our fathers
And, in record, left them the heirs of shame.
Another part of the field
And I Will stand the hazard of the die.
Another part of the field
And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,
And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so,
And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
An old Man, of the Capulet family.
An Apothecary.  
An Officer.
And the continuance of their parents' rage,
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
And made Verona's ancient citizens
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
And stole into the covert of the wood.
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
And private in his chamber pens himself,
And makes himself an artificial night.
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
An she agree, within her scope of choice
And like her most whose merit most shall be;
And the rank poison of the old will die.
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
And these, who, often drown'd, could never die,
And she shall scant show well that now seems best.
And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-
And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),
And since that time it is eleven years,
And then my husband (God be with his soul!
And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow
An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
And see how one another lends content;
And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
And soar with them above a common bound.
And in this state she 'gallops night by night
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
Anthony, and Potpan!
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.  
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
And young affection gapes to be his heir;
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
And she as much in love, her means much less
And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
An open et cetera, thou a pop'rin pear!
And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
And sails upon the bosom of the air.  
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
And for that name, which is no part of thee,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
And I am proof against their enmity.
And but thou love me, let them find me here.
And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,
And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;
And not impute this yielding to light love,
And I'll believe thee.
And yet I would it were to give again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
And from her womb children of divers kind
And vice sometime's by action dignified.
And where the worser is predominant,
And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then:
An old hare hoar,
And an old hare hoar,
And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
And his to me,
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
And in the taste confounds the appetite.
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
And reason coldly of your grievances,
And so good Capulet, which name I tender
And soundly too. Your houses!
And in my temper soft'ned valour's steel
And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
And bid him come to take his last farewell.
And thou art wedded to calamity.
And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
And turn'd that black word death to banishment.
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
And then down falls again.
And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,
And usest none in that true use indeed  
And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.
And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
And he shall signify from time to time
And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-  
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
And light thee on the way to Mantua.
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
And see how be will take it at your hands.
And yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,
And that we have a curse in having her.
And then to have a wretched puling fool,
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
And with this knife I'll help it presently.
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,
And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
And hither shall he come; and he and I
And this shall free thee from this present shame,
And gave him what becomed love I might,
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.
And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
And madly play with my forefathers' joints,
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud.,
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone
And never trouble Peter for the matter.
And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.
And doth it give me such a sight as this?
And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!
And with my child my joys are buried!  
And all the better is it for the maid.
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd
And all things change them to the contrary.
And go, Sir Paris. Every one prepare
And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips
And her immortal part with angels lives.
And presently took post to tell it you.
And hire posthorses. I will hence to-night.
And hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.
And hereabouts 'a dwells, which late I noted
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
And this same needy man must sell it me.
And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
And drink it off, and if you had the strength
And finding him, the searchers of the town,
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-
And do not interrupt me in my course.
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.
And here is come to do some villanous shame
And apprehend thee for a felon here.
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
And never from this palace of dim night
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
And fearfully did menace me with death
And that my master slew him.
And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!
And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
And then will I be general of your woes
And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,
And let mischance be slave to patience.
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
And bear this work of heaven with patience;
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
And then in post he came from Mantua
And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
And by-and-by my master drew on him;
And then I ran away to call the watch.
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
And I, for winking at you, discords too,
And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth'd brach.
And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent;
And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
And hang it round with all my wanton pictures;
And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet;
And if he chance to speak, be ready straight,
And with a low submissive reverence
Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
And ask him what apparel he will wear;
Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
And that his lady mourns at his disease;
And, when he says he is, say that he dreams,
And each one to his office when he wakes.
And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
And give them friendly welcome every one;
And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady;
And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
And say 'What is't your honour will command,
And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
And with declining head into his bosom,
And if the boy have not a woman's gift  
An onion will do well for such a shift,
Anon I'll give thee more instructions.     Exit a SERVINGMAN
And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
And twenty caged nightingales do sing.
And fetch shall echoes from the hollow earth.
And Cytherea all in sedges hid,
And how she was beguiled and surpris'd,
And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,
And yet she is inferior to none.
And not a tinker, nor Christopher Sly.
And once again, a pot o' th' smallest ale.
And rail upon the hostess of the house,
And say you would present her at the leet,
And Peter Turph, and Henry Pimpernell;
And twenty more such names and men as these,
And slept above some fifteen year or more.
And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy.
And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,
And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,  
And am to Padua come as he that leaves
And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.
And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
And take a lodging fit to entertain
And paint your face, and use you like a fool.
And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,
And make her bear the penance of her tongue?
And for I know she taketh most delight
And so, farewell. Katherina, you may stay;
And now in plainness do confess to thee,
And with her breath she did perfume the air;
And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
And undertake the teaching of the maid-
And be in Padua here Vincentio's son;
And I am tied to be obedient-
And let me be a slave t' achieve that maid
And therefore frame your manners to the time.
And I for my escape have put on his;
And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.
And then I know after who comes by the worst.
And could not get him for my heart to do it.
And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
Antonio, my father, is deceas'd,
And I have thrust myself into this maze,
And so am come abroad to see the world.  
And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich,
And very rich; but th'art too much my friend,
And I'll not wish thee to her.
And shrewd and froward so beyond all measure
An affable and courteous gentleman;
And he knew my deceased father well.
And therefore let me be thus bold with you
And her withholds from me, and other more,  
And offer me disguis'd in sober robes
And unsuspected court her by herself.
And see you read no other lectures to her.
And let me have them very well perfum'd;
And by good fortune I have lighted well
And other books- good ones, I warrant ye.
And I do hope good days and long to see.
And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
And bear his charge of wooing, whatsoe'er.
And, were his daughter fairer than she is,
And so she shall: Lucentio shall make one,
And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.
And will not promise her to any man
And if you break the ice, and do this feat,
And since you do profess to be a suitor,
And quaff carouses to our mistress' health;
And do as adversaries do in law-
And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
And, for an entrance to my entertainment,
And free access and favour as the rest.
And toward the education of your daughters
And this small packet of Greek and Latin books.
And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
And every day I cannot come to woo.
And, in possession, twenty thousand crowns.
And where two raging fires meet together,
And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering,
And with that word she struck me on the head,
And through the instrument my pate made way;
And there I stood amazed for a while,
And twangling Jack, with twenty such vile terms,
And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence.
And bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst;
And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
And now I find report a very liar;
And then let Kate be chaste, and Dian sportful!
And therefore, setting all this chat aside,  
And will you, nill you, I will marry you.
And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity.
And, to conclude, we have 'greed so well together
And kiss me, Kate; we will be married a Sunday.
And venture madly on a desperate mart.
And all things answerable to this portion.
And if I die to-morrow this is hers,
And twelve tight galleys. These I will assure her,
And twice as much whate'er thou off'rest next.
And she can have no more than all I have;
And let your father make her the assurance,
And so I take my leave, and thank you both.
An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.              Exit
And that's a wonder- fathers commonly
And when in music we have spent an hour,
And while I pause serve in your harmony.
And to cut off all strife: here sit we down;
And there it is in writing fairly drawn.
And help to dress your sister's chamber up.
And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
And, to be noted for a merry man,
And say 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
And yet not many.
And wherefore gaze this goodly company
An eye-sore to our solemn festival!
And sent you hither so unlike yourself?
And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa,
And make assurance here in Padua  
And marry sweet Bianca with consent.
And watch our vantage in this business;
And as he stoop'd again to take it up,
And threw the sops all in the sexton's face,
And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
And I, seeing this, came thence for very shame;
And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
And have prepar'd great store of wedding cheer
And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
And, honest company, I thank you all
And here she stands; touch her whoever dare;
And let Bianca take her sister's room.
And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?
And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' th' heel;
And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing;
And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:
And serve it thus to me that love it not?
And I expressly am forbid to touch it;
And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
And for this night we'll fast for company.
And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
And sits as one new risen from a dream.
And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
And till she stoop she must not be full-gorg'd,
Another way I have to man my haggard,
And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
And, in conclusion, she shall watch all night;
And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl  
And with the clamour keep her still awake.
And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
And makes a god of such a cullion.
And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
And have forsworn you with Hortensio.
An ancient angel coming down the hill
And give assurance to Baptista Minola
And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.
And come to Padua, careless of your life!
And think it not the worst of all your fortunes
And in my house you shall be friendly lodg'd;
And that which spites me more than all these wants-
And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.
And revel it as bravely as the best,
And gentlewomen wear such caps as these.
And not till then.
And speak I will. I am no child, no babe.
And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
And rather than it shall, I will be free
And it I will have, or I will have none.    Exit HABERDASHER
And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
And therefore frolic; we will hence forthwith
And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;
And well we may come there by dinner-time.  
And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.
And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.
And- for the good report I hear of you,
And for the love he beareth to your daughter,
And she to him- to stay him not too long,  
And therefore, if you say no more than this,
And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
And happily we might be interrupted.
And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
And, if you will, tell what hath happened-
And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.      Exit LUCENTIO
And be it moon, or sun, or what you please;
And if you please to call it a rush-candle,
And the moon changes even as your mind.
And so it shall be so for Katherine.
And not unluckily against the bias.
And not a maiden, as thou sayst he is.
And bound I am to Padua, there to visit
And now by law, as well as reverend age,
And wander we to see thy honest son,
And by all likelihood some cheer is toward.         [Knocks]
And happily I have arrived at the last
And time it is when raging war is done
And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,
And now you know my meaning.
And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
And, as the jest did glance away from me,
And he whose wife is most obedient,
An awful rule, and right supremacy;
And, to be short, what not that's sweet and happy.  
Another dowry to another daughter,
And show more sign of her obedience,
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes
And in no sense is meet or amiable.
And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
And for thy maintenance commits his body
And craves no other tribute at thy hands
And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
And not obedient to his honest will,
And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
And place your hands below your husband's foot;
And being a winner, God give you good night!
And gape at wid'st to glut him.
And thy no greater father.
And pluck my magic garment from me. So,
And left me to a bootless inquisition,
And rather like a dream than an assurance
And princess no worse issued.
And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
And to my state grew stranger, being transported
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle-
And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.
And executing th' outward face of royalty
And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
And then I'll bring thee to the present busines
An undergoing stomach, to bear up
And give it way. I know thou canst not choose.
And burn in many places; on the topmast,
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
And all the devils are here.'
And all the rest o' th' fleet?
And are upon the Mediterranean flote
And his great person perish.
And here was left by th'sailors. Thou, my slave,
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
And in her most unmitigable rage,
And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans
And peg thee in his knotty entrails, till
And do my spriting gently.
And hither come in 't. Go, hence with diligence!
And blister you all o'er!  
And show'd thee all the qualities o' th' isle,
And make a vassal of him.
And then take hands;
And, sweet sprites, the burden bear.
And say what thou seest yond.
And strays about to find 'em.
And that you will some good instruction give  
And that he does I weep. Myself am Naples,
And his brave son being twain.
And his more braver daughter could control thee,  
And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you
And make thy weapon drop.
An advocate for an impostor! hush!
And they to him are angels.
And have no vigour in them.
Another part of the island
And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,
And time to speak it in; you rub the sore,
And use of service, none; contract, succession,
And women too, but innocent and pure;
And watch your safety.
And yet methinks I see it in thy face,
And yet so fast asleep.
Another way so high a hope, that even
And by that destiny, to perform an act
And let Sebastian wake.' Say this were death
And look how well my garments sit upon me,
And melt, ere they molest! Here lies your brother,
And I the King shall love thee.
And when I rear my hand, do you the like,
And that a strange one too, which did awake me;
Another part of the island
And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,
And after bite me; then like hedgehogs which
And I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts;
And makes my labours pleasures. O, she is
And he's compos'd of harshness. I must remove
And yours it is against.
And put it to the foil; but you, O you,
And my dear father. How features are abroad,
Any companion in the world but you;
And crown what I profess with kind event,
And all the more it seeks to hide itself,
And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
And I thus humble ever.
Another part of the island
And take his bottle from him. When that's gone
And that most deeply to consider is
And bring thee forth brave brood.
And scout 'em and flout 'em;
Another part of the island
And what does else want credit, come to me,
And I'll be sworn 'tis true; travellers ne'er did lie,
And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea
And even with such-like valour men hang and drown
And will not be uplifted. But remember-
And a clear life ensuing.
And observation strange, my meaner ministers
And these mine enemies are all knit up
And in these fits I leave them, while I visit
And his and mine lov'd darling.                   Exit above
And with him there lie mudded.                          Exit
And hinder them from what this ecstasy
And make it halt behind her.
And they expect it from me.
And breathe twice, and cry 'so, so,'
And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;
And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky hard,
And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown  
And some donation freely to estate
And be a boy right out.                       [JUNO alights]
And honour'd in their issue.                     [They sing]
Answer your summons; Juno does command.
And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
And there repose; a turn or two I'll walk
And as with age his body uglier grows,
And do the murder first. If he awake,
And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes
And the remainder mourning over them,
And they shall be themselves.
And ye that on the sands with printless foot
And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault
And deeper than did ever plummet sound
And as the morning steals upon the night,
And presently, I prithee.
And to thee and thy company I bid
An if this be at all-a most strange story.  
And justify you traitors; at this time
And rest myself content.
And subjects none abroad; pray you, look in.
And I would call it fair play.
And brought us thus together?
And on this couple drop a blessed crown;
And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife
And-how, we know not-all clapp'd under hatches;
And moe diversity of sounds, all horrible,
And were brought moping hither.
And there is in this business more than nature
And think of each thing well.  [Aside to ARIEL]  Come
And deal in her command without her power.
And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass
And worship this dull fool!
And the particular accidents gone by
And thence retire me to my Milan, where
And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,
And sail so expeditious that shall catch
And what strength I have's mine own,
And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell
And my ending is despair
And being enfranchis'd, bid him come to me.
And my estate deserves an heir more rais'd
And I have bred her at my dearest cost
And dispossess her all.
And make him weigh with her.
And you shall find I like it; wait attendance
And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred out
And taste Lord Timon's bounty? He outgoes
And call him to long peace.
And at that instant like a babe sprung up.
And spend our flatteries to drink those men
And entertain'd me with mine own device;
And all out of an empty coffer;
And ne'er be weary. Alcibiades,
And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold.
And able horses. No porter at his gate,
And my reliances on his fracted dates
And have the dates in compt.
And the detention of long-since-due debts,
Answer not: I am gone.                             Exit PAGE
And that unaptness made your minister
And say you found them in mine honesty.
And your great flow of debts. My lov'd lord,
And what remains will hardly stop the mouth
And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,
And set mine eyes at flow.
And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,
And so, intending other serious matters,
And nature, as it grows again toward earth,
And we alive that liv'd? Fly, damned baseness,
And when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature
And he that's once denied will hardly speed.            Exit
And kept his credit with his purse;
And yet- O, see the monstrousness of man
And honourable carriage,
And the best half should have return'd to him,
And now Ventidius is wealthy too,
And does he send to me? Three? Humh!
And does he think so backwardly of me now
And with their faint reply this answer join:
And this is all a liberal course allows:
And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels
And send for money for 'em.  
And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.
And take down th' int'rest into their glutt'nous maws.
And if it be so far beyond his health,
And make a clear way to the gods.
And none but tyrants use it cruelly.
An honour in him which buys out his fault-
And with such sober and unnoted passion
And make his wrongs his outsides,
And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,
And not endure all threats? Sleep upon't,
And let the foes quietly cut their throats,
And the ass more captain than the lion; the fellow
And slain in fight many of your enemies;
And cherish factions. 'Tis inferr'd to us  
And be in debt to none- yet, more to move you,
And, for I know your reverend ages love
And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent.
And minister in their steads. To general filths
And cut your trusters' throats. Bound servants, steal:
And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed:
And let confusion live. Plagues incident to men,
And drown themselves in riot. Itches, blains,
And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow
And go along with him?
And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,
And say 'This man's a flatterer'? If one be,
And give them title, knee, and approbation,  
And thee after, when thou hast conquer'd!
And mince it sans remorse. Swear against abjects;
And to make whores a bawd. Hold up, you sluts,
And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you-  
And be no turncoats. Yet may your pains six months
And mar men's spurring. Crack the lawyer's voice,
And not believes himself. Down with the nose,
And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war
And ditches grave you all!
And morsels unctuous, greases his pure mind,
And let his very breath whom thou'lt observe
And call it excellent. Thou wast told thus;
And skip when thou point'st out? Will the cold brook,
Answer mere nature- bid them flatter thee.
And mak'st them kiss! that speak'st with every tongue  
And so scape hanging. Trust not the physician;
And her pale fire she snatches from the sun;
And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd!
And thou redeem'st thyself. But all, save thee,
And may diseases lick up their false bloods!
And so, farewell and thrive.
And comfort you, my master.  
And sweetly felt it.
And chance it as it may.
And send forth us to make their sorrowed render,
And write in thee the figures of their love,
And I'll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.
And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take
And take our goodly aged men by th' beards,
And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not,
And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still;
And last so long enough!
And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,
And shortly must I fell it. Tell my friends,
And hang himself. I pray you do my greeting.
And let my gravestone be your oracle.
And strain what other means is left unto us
And made us speak like friends. This man was riding
An ag'd interpreter, though young in days;
And pursy insolence shall break his wind
And by the hazard of the spotted die
And not as our confusion, all thy powers
And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which
And I will use the olive, with my sword;
And, countrymen, my loving followers,
And suffer not dishonour to approach
And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.
And slain the noblest prisoner of the Goths.
And now at last, laden with honour's spoils,
And in the Capitol and Senate's right,
And so I love and honour thee and thine,
And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,
And to my fortunes and the people's favour
And to the love and favour of my country
And brought to yoke the enemies of Rome.
And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars.  
And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,
Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood.
And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,
And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,
And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.
And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy
And fame's eternal date, for virtue's praise!
And triumphs over chance in honour's bed.  
And name thee in election for the empire
And help to set a head on headless Rome.
And set abroad new business for you all?
And led my country's strength successfully,
And buried one and twenty valiant sons,
Andronicus, would thou were shipp'd to hell
And gratulate his safe return to Rome,
And ripen justice in this commonweal.
And say 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine!'
And will with deeds requite thy gentleness;
And for an onset, Titus, to advance
And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse.
And here in sight of Rome, to Saturnine,
And with my sword I'll keep this door safe.
And will create thee Emperess of Rome.  
And here I swear by all the Roman gods-
And tapers burn so bright, and everything
And with these boys mine honour thou hast wounded.
Answer I must, and shall do with my life.
And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.
And basely put it up without revenge?
And so supplant you for ingratitude,  
And raze their faction and their family,
And make them know what 'tis to let a queen
And must advise the Emperor for his good.
And let it be mine honour, good my lord,
And fear not, lords- and you, Lavinia.
And at my lovely Tamora's entreats,
And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,
And overlooks the highest-peering hills,
And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.
And mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long.
And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes
And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.
And manners, to intrude where I am grac'd,
And may, for aught thou knowest, affected be.
And so in this, to bear me down with braves.
And that my sword upon thee shall approve,
And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.
And maintain such a quarrel openly?
And with thy weapon nothing dar'st perform.
And cannot brook competitors in love?
And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?
And many unfrequented plots there are
And strike her home by force if not by words.
And she shall file our engines with advice
And revel in Lavinia's treasury.
And wake the Emperor and his lovely bride,
And rouse the Prince, and ring a hunter's peal,
And to our sport.  [To TAMORA]  Madam, now shall ye see
And climb the highest promontory top.
And never after to inherit it.
And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest
And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground;
And while the babbling echo mocks the hounds,
And- after conflict such as was suppos'd
And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave-
And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.
And give the King this fatal-plotted scroll.
And to be doubted that your Moor and you
And wand'red hither to an obscure plot,
And let her joy her raven-coloured love;
And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,
And leave me to this miserable death.
And then they call'd me foul adulteress,
And had you not by wondrous fortune come,
And with that painted hope braves your mightiness;
And shall she carry this unto her grave?
And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.
And with thine own hands kill me in this place!
And tumble me into some loathsome pit,
And let my spleenful sons this trull deflower.          Exit
And see a fearful sight of blood and death.
And shows the ragged entrails of this pit;
And what he is that now is leapt into it.
And wonder greatly that man's face can fold
Another part of the forest
An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.
And so let's leave her to her silent walks.
And might not gain so great a happiness
And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.
And notwithstanding all this loss of blood-
And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind;
And he hath cut those pretty fingers off
And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,
And for these bitter tears, which now you see
And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,
And let me say, that never wept before,
And you recount your sorrows to a stone.  
And bootless unto them.
And were they but attired in grave weeds,
And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.
And now like Nilus it disdaineth bounds.
And they have nurs'd this woe in feeding life;
And they have serv'd me to effectless use.
And here my brother, weeping at my woes.
And thou and I sit round about some fountain,
And in the fountain shall we gaze so long,
And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?
And send it to the King: he for the same
And that shall be the ransom for their fault.
And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.
And rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe,
And never whilst I live deceive men so;
And that you'll say ere half an hour pass.
And yet dear too, because I bought mine own.
And bow this feeble ruin to the earth;
And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds
And do not break into these deep extremes.
And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
And here's thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back-
And be my heart an ever-burning hell!
And yet detested life not shrink thereat!
And would usurp upon my wat'ry eyes
And make them blind with tributary tears.
And threat me I shall never come to bliss  
And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
And in this hand the other will I bear.
And, Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd in this;
And if ye love me, as I think you do,
And make proud Saturnine and his emperess
And cannot passionate our tenfold grief
And just against thy heart make thou a hole,
And by still practice learn to know thy meaning.
And tears will quickly melt thy life away.
And buzz lamenting doings in the air!
And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle.        Exeunt
And I have read that Hecuba of Troy
And would not, but in fury, fright my youth;
And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,
And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens
And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape;
And rape, I fear, was root of thy annoy.
And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.
And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope;
And swear with me- as, with the woeful fere  
And father of that chaste dishonoured dame,
And see their blood or die with this reproach.
And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,
And when he sleeps will she do what she list.
And come, I will go get a leaf of brass,
And with a gad of steel will write these words,
And lay it by. The angry northern wind
And where's our lesson, then? Boy, what say you?
And not relent, or not compassion him?
And so I do, and with his gifts present
And so I leave you both-  [Aside]  like bloody villains.
And sends them weapons wrapp'd about with lines
And now, young lords, was't not a happy star
And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point.
And from your womb where you imprisoned were
And we will all subscribe to thy advice.
And no one else but the delivered Empress.
And now be it known to you my full intent:
And tell them both the circumstance of all,
And how by this their child shall be advanc'd,
And be received for the Emperor's heir
And substituted in the place of mine,
And let the Emperor dandle him for his own.
And you must needs bestow her funeral;  
And secretly to greet the Empress' friends.
And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
And cabin in a cave, and bring you up  
And pierce the inmost centre of the earth;
And that it comes from old Andronicus,
And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd.
And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice.
And feed his humour kindly as we may
And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine.
And pull her out of Acheron by the heels.
And, sith there's no justice in earth nor hell,
And who should find them but the Empress' villain?
And when thou hast given it to the Emperor,
An emperor in Rome thus overborne,
And now he writes to heaven for his redress.
And blazoning our unjustice every where?
And rather comfort his distressed plight
And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor.
And will revolt from me to succour him.
And is not careful what they mean thereby,
And if he stand on hostage for his safety,
And temper him with all the art I have,  
And now, sweet Emperor, be blithe again,
And bury all thy fear in my devices.
And how desirous of our sight they are.
And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,
And be aveng'd on cursed Tamora.  
And as I earnestly did fix mine eye
And here's the base fruit of her burning lust.
And by his side his fruit of bastardy.
And bear it from me to the Emperess.
And this shall all be buried in my death,
And hast a thing within thee called conscience,
An idiot holds his bauble for a god,
And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,
And cut her hands, and trimm'd her as thou sawest.
And hid the gold within that letter mention'd,
And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,
And, when I had it, drew myself apart
And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter.
And when I told the Empress of this sport,
And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.
And bid the owners quench them with their tears.
And set them upright at their dear friends' door
And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,
And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
And, for he understands you are in arms,
And they shall be immediately deliver'd.
And we will come. March away.                         Exeunt
And say I am Revenge, sent from below
And work confusion on his enemies.
And all my study be to no effect?
And what is written shall be executed.
And in their ears tell them my dreadful name-
And then I'll come and be thy waggoner
And whirl along with thee about the globes.
And find out murderers in their guilty caves;
And when thy car is loaden with their heads,  
And day by day I'll do this heavy task,
And you the Empress! But we worldly men
And, if one arm's embracement will content thee,
And, being credulous in this mad thought,
And whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,
And, would you represent our queen aright,
And I am sent to be reveng'd on him.
And I will be revenged on them all.
And when thou find'st a man that's like thyself,
And bid him come and banquet at thy house;
And at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel,
And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.
And take my ministers along with me.
And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.
And tarry with him till I turn again.
And will o'er reach them in their own devices,
And therefore bind them, gentle Publius-
And now I find it; therefore bind them sure,
And stop their mouths if they begin to cry.             Exit
And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad.
And with your blood and it I'll make a paste;
And of the paste a coffin I will rear,
And make two pasties of your shameful heads;
And bid that strumpet, your unhallowed dam,
And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;
And worse than Progne I will be reveng'd.
And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,
And with this hateful liquor temper it;
And in that paste let their vile heads be bak'd.
And see them ready against their mother comes.
And see the ambush of our friends be strong;
And prompt me that my tongue may utter forth
And welcome all. Although the cheer be poor,
And by her presence still renew his sorrows.
And with thy shame thy father's sorrow die!
And have a thousand times more cause than he
And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong.
And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to,
And break my utt'rance, even in the time
And force you to commiseration.
And they it were that ravished our sister.
And sent her enemies unto the grave.
And op'd their arms to embrace me as a friend.
And from her bosom took the enemy's point,
And, from the place where you behold us pleading,
And on the ragged stones beat forth our souls,
And make a mutual closure of our house.
And bring our Emperor gently in thy hand,
And hither hale that misbelieving Moor
And bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind
And talk of them when he was dead and gone.
And give him burial in his father's grave.
And being dead, let birds on her take pity.           Exeunt
And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge
And Antenorides, with massy staples
And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,
And skilless as unpractis'd infancy.
And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts-
And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo
And, like as there were husbandry in war,
And to the field goes he; where every flower
And stands alone.
And that unbodied figure of the thought  
And call them shames, which are, indeed, nought else
And what hath mass or matter by itself
And flies fled under shade-why, then the thing of courage
And with an accent tun'd in self-same key
And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,
And look how many Grecian tents do stand
And therefore is the glorious planet Sol
And posts, like the commandment of a king,
And hark what discord follows! Each thing melts
And make a sop of all this solid globe;
And the rude son should strike his father dead;  
And appetite, an universal wolf,
And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,
And this neglection of degree it is
And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,  
And with ridiculous and awkward action-
And like a strutting player whose conceit
And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age
And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,
And bid the cheek be ready with a blush
And then to speak.
And every Greek of mettle, let him know
And to this purpose speak: Kings, princes, lords!
And dare avow her beauty and her worth
And will to-morrow with his trumpet call
And may that soldier a mere recreant prove
And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,
And, meeting him, will tell him that my lady
And find the welcome of a noble foe.
And, in the publication, make no strain  
And in such indexes, although small pricks
And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,
And think perchance they'll sell; if not, the lustre
And it were better parch in Afric sun
And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw
And I will give a taste thereof forthwith
And buckle in a waist most fathomless
And reason flies the object of all harm.
And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,
And the will dotes that is attributive
And did him service. He touch'd the ports desir'd;
And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive
And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.
And cried 'Inestimable!' -why do you now
And do a deed that never fortune did-
And I will fill them with prophetic tears.
And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us
And had as ample power as I have will,
And on the cause and question now in hand
And that great minds, of partial indulgence
And fame in time to come canonize us;
An after-dinner's breath.
And under-honest, in self-assumption greater
And underwrite in an observing kind
And speaks not to himself but with a pride
And batters down himself. What should I say?
And never suffers matter of the world
And ruminate himself-shall he be worshipp'd
And add more coals to Cancer when he burns
And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.'
And give him half; and, for thy vigour,
And here's a lord-come knights from east to west
And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.
And give me swift transportance to these fields
And fly with me to Cressid!
And all my powers do their bestowing lose,
And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,
And fell so roundly to a large confession
And simpler than the infancy of truth.
And sanctify the numbers.
And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,
And mighty states characterless are grated
And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here,
And here, to do you service, am become
And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence
And bring us Cressid hither. Calchas shall have
And not a man for being simply man
And apprehended here immediately
And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow-
An act that very chance doth throw upon him-
And great Troy shrinking.
And leave you hindmost;
And with his arms out-stretch'd, as he would fly,
And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not virtue seek
And give to dust that is a little gilt
And still it might, and yet it may again,
And case thy reputation in thy tent,
And drave great Mars to faction.
And better would it fit Achilles much
And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing
And your great love to me restrains you thus.
And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,
And danger, like an ague, subtly taints
An appetite that I am sick withal,
And I myself see not the bottom of it.
And you as well to keep her that defend her,
And give as soft attachment to thy senses
And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,
And then you would have tarried. Hark! there's one up.
Antenor! The young prince will go mad. A plague upon Antenor! I
And haste her to the purpose.
And to his hand when I deliver her,
And would, as I shall pity, I could help!
And violenteth in a sense as strong
And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,
And I will see thee.
And flowing o'er with arts and exercise.
And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,
And bring Aeneas and the Grecian with you.
And by the way possess thee what she is.
Anticipating time with starting courage.
And hale him hither.
And parted thus you and your argument.
And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
And daughters of the game.                       [Trumpet within]
And that which looks like pride is courtesy.
And this is Troyan; the sinews of this leg
And signify this loving interview
And formless ruin of oblivion;
And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,
And once fought with him. He was a soldier good,
And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.
And that old common arbitrator, Time,
And quoted joint by joint.
And make distinct the very breach whereout
And you, Achilles, let these threats alone
An oath that I have sworn. I will not break it.
And let your mind be coupled with your words.
And gives memorial dainty kisses to it,
And by herself, I will not tell you whose.
And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.
An esperance so obstinately strong,
And yet the spacious breadth of this division
And with another knot, five-finger-tied,
And they'll seem glorious.
And rob in the behalf of charity.
And tempt not yet the brushes of the war.
And when we have our armours buckled on,
And I do stand engag'd to many Greeks,
And all cry, Hector! Hector's dead! O Hector!
Another part of the plain
And am her knight by proof.
And stands colossus-wise, waving his beam,
And bid the snail-pac'd Ajax arm for shame.
And there lacks work; anon he's there afoot,
And there they fly or die, like scaled sculls
And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,
And foams at mouth, and he is arm'd and at it,
Another part of the plain
And pay thy life thou owest me for my horse.
Another part of the plain
And when I have the bloody Hector found,
Another part of the plain
And, stickler-like, the armies separates.
Another part of the plain
Another part of the plain
And linger not our sure destructions on.
And being once subdu'd in armed trail,
And at that time bequeath you my diseases.                   Exit
And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
And water once a day her chamber round
And lasting in her sad remembrance.
And then 'twas fresh in murmur- as, you know,
And sight of men.
And might not be delivered to the world,
And though that nature with a beauteous wall
And speak to him in many sorts of music,
And tell them there thy fixed foot shall grow
And all is semblative a woman's part.
And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord
And leave the world no copy.
And in dimension and the shape of nature
And call upon my soul within the house;
And sing them loud even in the dead of night;
And make the babbling gossip of the air
And let your fervour, like my master's, be
And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;
And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.
An elder than herself; so wears she to him,
And the free maids that weave their thread with bones,
And dallies with the innocence of love,
And in sad cypress let me be laid;
And can digest as much. Make no compare
And that I owe Olivia.  
And with a green and yellow melancholy
And all the brothers too- and yet I know not.  
And to do that well craves a kind of wit.
And, like the haggard, check at every feather
And baited it with all th' unmuzzled thoughts
And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,
And that no woman has; nor never none
And so adieu, good madam; never more
And not all love to see you- though so much
And thanks, and ever thanks; and oft good turns
An hour.
And suits well for a servant with my fortunes.
And laid mine honour too unchary out;
And I beseech you come again to-morrow.
And part being prompted by your present trouble,
And to his image, which methought did promise
And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks
And anon, sir,
And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,
And wrangle with my reason, that persuades me
And underneath that consecrated roof,
And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.
And this is he that did the Tiger board
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,
And grew a twenty years removed thing
And that I partly know the instrument
And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,
And all the ceremony of this compact
An apple cleft in two is not more twin
And say 'Thrice welcome, drowned Viola!'
And all those swearings keep as true in soul
And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.
And yet, alas, now I remember me,
And since you call'd me master for so long,
And tell me, in the modesty of honour,
And, acting this in an obedient hope,
And made the most notorious geck and gul
And now I do bethink me, it was she
And in such forms which here were presuppos'd
And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
And we'll strive to please you every day.
And yet you never swum the Hellespont.
And he that is so yoked by a fool,
And all the fair effects of future hopes.
And I likewise will visit thee with mine.
And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.
An if the shepherd be awhile away.
And you an officer fit for the place.
And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
And would not force the letter to my view!
And presently, all humbled, kiss the rod!
And ask remission for my folly past.
And not upon your maid.
And yet methinks I do not like this tune.
And mar the concord with too harsh a descant;
And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
And throw it thence into the raging sea.
And yet I will not, sith so prettily
And did request me to importune you
And how he cannot be a perfect man,
And perfected by the swift course of time.
And be in eye of every exercise
And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,
And to commend their service to his will.
And- in good time!- now will we break with him.
And daily graced by the Emperor;
And not depending on his friendly wish.
And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.
And with the vantage of mine own excuse
And by an by a cloud takes all away!
And yet a thousand times it answers 'No.'             Exeunt
And now you are metamorphis'd with a mistress, that, when I look
And yet-
And yet I will not name it- and yet I care not.
And yet take this again- and yet I thank you-
And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.
And so good morrow, servant.                     Exit SILVIA
And when that hour o'erslips me in the day
And not without desert so well reputed.
And though myself have been an idle truant,
And, in a word, for far behind his worth
And here he means to spend his time awhile.  
And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.
And hath so humbled me as I confess
And I must minister the like to you.  
And, of so great a favour growing proud,
And make rough winter everlastingly.
And I as rich in having such a jewel
And then I'll presently attend you.
And that I love him not as I was wont.
And that's the reason I love him so little.
And that hath dazzled my reason's light;
And ev'n that pow'r which gave me first my oath
And he wants wit that wants resolved will
And Silvia- witness heaven, that made her fair!-
And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,
And, ev'n in kind love, I do conjure thee,
And when the flight is made to one so dear,
And so by many winding nooks he strays,
And make a pastime of each weary step,
And there I'll rest as, after much turmoil,  
And instances of infinite of love,
And presently go with me to my chamber,
And should she thus be stol'n away from you,
And oftentimes have purpos'd to forbid
And so, unworthily, disgrace the man,
And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,
And thence she cannot be convey'd away.  
And with a corded ladder fetch her down;
And this way comes he with it presently;
And I am going to deliver them.  
And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,
And, where I thought the remnant of mine age  
And turn her out to who will take her in.
And nought esteems my aged eloquence.
And kept severely from resort of men,
And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
And here an engine fit for my proceeding!
And slaves they are to me, that send them flying.
And with thy daring folly burn the world?
And think my patience, more than thy desert,
And Silvia is myself; banish'd from her
And feed upon the shadow of perfection.
And now excess of it will make me surfeit.
And study help for that which thou lament'st.
And manage it against despairing thoughts.
And, ere I part with thee, confer at large
And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.
And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.
And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you-
And afterward determine our proceedings.
An heir, and near allied unto the Duke.
And, partly, seeing you are beautified  
And live as we do in this wilderness?
And show thee all the treasure we have got;  
And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.
And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
And give some evening music to her ear.
And, being help'd, inhabits there.
And by and by intend to chide myself
And to your shadow will I make true love.
And make it but a shadow, as I am.
And so, good rest.
And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,
And on the justice of my flying hence
And will employ thee in some service presently.  
And thinking on it makes me cry 'Alas!'
And now am I, unhappy messenger,  
And full of new-found oaths, which he wul break
And threw her sun-expelling mask away,
And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,
And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown;
And at that time I made her weep a good,
And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,
And were there sense in his idolatry
And now it is about the very hour
And yet she takes exceptions at your person.
And Eglamour is in her company.
And will not use a woman lawlessly.
Another part of the forest
And to the nightingale's complaining notes
And leave no memory of what it was!
And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.
And full as much, for more there cannot be,
And that's far worse than none; better have none
And love you 'gainst the nature of love- force ye.
And once again I do receive thee honest.
And, that my love may appear plain and free,
And Julia herself have brought it hither.
And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.
And leave her on such slight conditions.
And think thee worthy of an empress' love.
And let them be recall'd from their exile:
And fit for great employment, worthy lord.
And yet we should for perpetuity
And pay them when you part.
And to be boy eternal.
And bleat the one at th' other. What we chang'd
And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
And clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter
And well become the agent. 'T may, I grant;
And yet the steer, the heifer, and the calf,
And fellow'st nothing. Then 'tis very credent
And that beyond commission; and I find it,
And that to the infection of my brains
And hard'ning of my brows.
And with his varying childness cures in me
And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,
And arms her with the boldness of a wife
And many a man there is, even at this present,
And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by
And therein negligent; or else a fool
And tak'st it all for jest.
And with your queen. I am his cupbearer;
And flourish'd after, I'd not do't; but since
And cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo,
And will, by twos and threes, at several posterns,
And tell's a tale.
And give't me in mine ear.
And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge
And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,
And mannerly distinguishment leave out
And I had rather glib myself than they
And one who much I honour.
And never to my red-look'd anger be
And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she
And downright languish'd. Leave me solely. Go,
And in his parties, his alliance. Let him be,
And I beseech you hear me, who professes
And would by combat make her good, so were I
And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;  
And, might we lay th' old proverb to your charge,
And copy of the father- eye, nose, lip,
And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it
And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd
And see it instantly consum'd with fire;
And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,
And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;
And call me father? Better burn it now
And nobleness impose. At least, thus much:
And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune
Another's issue.
An hour since. Cleomenes and Dion,
And think upon my bidding.                            Exeunt
And the ear-deaf'ning voice o' th' oracle,
And gracious be the issue!                            Exeunt
And play'd to take spectators; for behold me-
And only that I stand for. I appeal
And why he left your court, the gods themselves,
And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame-
And first fruits of my body, from his presence
And in Apollo's name, his oracle.
And see what death is doing.
And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest
And then run mad indeed, stark mad; for all
And damnable ingrateful. Nor was't much
And I'll say nothing.
And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,
And frown upon 's.
And, gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
And still rest thine. The storm begins. Poor wretch,
And what to her adheres, which follows after,
And when I wander here and there,
And bear the sow-skin budget,
And in the stocks avouch it.
And merrily hent the stile-a;
And you the Queen on't.
And let's be red with mirth.
And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,
And welcome to our shearing.
And make conceive a bark of baser kind
And do not call them bastards.
And with him rises weeping; these are flow'rs
And only live by gazing.
And own no other function. Each your doing,
And the true blood which peeps fairly through't,
Any silk, any thread,
Any toys for your head,
And handed love as you do, I was wont
And nothing marted with him. If your lass
And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to't:
And, daughter, yours.
And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks.
And so deliver: I am put to sea
And most opportune to her need I have
And that unhappy king, my master, whom
And through him what's nearest to him, which is
And with my best endeavours in your absence
And bring him up to liking.
And after that trust to thee.
And there present yourself and your fair princess-
And speak his very heart.
And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,
And come again to me; who, on my life,
And better us'd, would make her sainted spirit
And begin 'Why to me'-
And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;
And those but mean.
And your fair princess- goddess! O, alas!
And those that bear them living.
And mark what way I make. Come, good my lord.         Exeunt
And so we wept; and there was the first gentleman-like tears that
And do not say 'tis superstition that
And take you by the hand, but then you'll think-
And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;
And from your sacred vials pour your graces
And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;
An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,
And take her by the hand whose worth and honesty  
And son unto the King, whom heavens directing,
And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale,
And often reading what contents it bears;  
And, true to bondage, would not break from thence,
And often kissed, and often 'gan to tear;
And, privileged by age, desires to know
And comely distant sits he by her side;
And when in his fair parts she did abide,
And every light occasion of the wind
And nice affections wavering stood in doubt
And controversy hence a question takes
And dialogued for him what he would say,
And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them
And was my own fee-simple, not in part,
And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling;
And bastards of his foul adulterate heart.
And be not of my holy vows afraid.
And so much less of shame in me remains
And reigned commanding in his monarchy.
And deep-brained sonnets that did amplify
And makes her absence valiant, not her might.
And now she would the caged cloister fly.
And now to tempt all liberty procured.
And mine I pour your ocean all among.
And sweetens, in the suff'ring pangs it bears,
And supplicant their sighs to your extend,
And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath,
And, veiled in them, did win whom he would maim.
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
And being frank she lends to those are free:
And that unfair which fairly doth excel:
And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,
And kept unused the user so destroys it:  
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,
And threescore year would make the world away:
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,
And sable curls all silvered o'er with white:  
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
And die as fast as they see others grow,
And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
And your sweet semblance to some other give.
And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
And yet methinks I have astronomy,
And constant stars in them I read such art
And wear their brave state out of memory.
And all in war with Time for love of you,
And fortify your self in your decay
And many maiden gardens yet unset,
And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
And your true rights be termed a poet's rage,
And stretched metre of an antique song.
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
And often is his gold complexion dimmed,
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood,
And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,
And do whate'er thou wilt swift-footed Time
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:
And for a woman wert thou first created,
And by addition me of thee defeated,
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
And then believe me, my love is as fair,
And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
And perspective it is best painter's art.
And in themselves their pride lies buried,
And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:
And puts apparel on my tattered loving,
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
And each (though enemies to either's reign)
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
And look upon my self and curse my fate,
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,
And moan th' expense of many a vanished sight.
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,
And all those friends which I thought buried.
And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
And though they be outstripped by every pen,
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,
And from the forlorn world his visage hide
And make me travel forth without my cloak,
And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
And 'gainst my self a lawful plea commence:
And by a part of all thy glory live:
And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?
And our dear love lose name of single one,
And that thou teachest how to make one twain,
And yet love knows it is a greater grief
And when a woman woos, what woman's son,
And chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth,
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly,
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
And losing her, my friend hath found that loss,
And both for my sake lay on me this cross,
And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.
And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.
And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
And by their verdict is determined
And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.
And each doth good turns now unto the other,
And to the painted banquet bids my heart:
Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part.
And I am still with them, and they with thee.
And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,
And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,
And this my hand, against my self uprear,
And you but one, can every shadow lend:
And you in Grecian tires are painted new:  
And you in every blessed shape we know.
And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
And broils root out the work of masonry,
And patience tame to sufferance bide each check,
And Time that gave, doth now his gift confound.
And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.
And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand
And all my soul, and all my every part;
And for this sin there is no remedy,
And for my self mine own worth do define,
And all those beauties whereof now he's king
And they shall live, and he in them still green.
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage.
And the firm soil win of the watery main,
And needy nothing trimmed in jollity,
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
And strength by limping sway disabled
And art made tongue-tied by authority,
And folly (doctor-like) controlling skill,
And simple truth miscalled simplicity,
And captive good attending captain ill.
And with his presence grace impiety,
And lace it self with his society?  
And steal dead seeming of his living hue?
And proud of many, lives upon his gains?
And him as for a map doth Nature store,
And that in guess they measure by thy deeds,
And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
And mock you with me after I am gone.
And hang more praise upon deceased I,
And live no more to shame nor me, nor you.
And so should you, to love things nothing worth.
And that is this, and this with thee remains.
And for the peace of you I hold such strife
And by and by clean starved for a look,
And keep invention in a noted weed,
And you and love are still my argument:
And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.  
And found such fair assistance in my verse,
And under thee their poesy disperse.
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,
And given grace a double majesty.
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be.
And my sick muse doth give an other place.
And found it in thy cheek: he can afford
And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,
And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
And therefore art enforced to seek anew,
And do so love, yet when they have devised,
And their gross painting might be better used,
And therefore to your fair no painting set,
And therefore have I slept in your report,
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.
And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen,
And to the most of praise add something more,
And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,
And for that riches where is my deserving?
And so my patent back again is swerving.
And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn:
And I by this will be a gainer too,
And I will comment upon that offence,
And haply of our old acquaintance tell.  
And do not drop in for an after-loss:
And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
And having thee, of all men's pride I boast.
And life no longer than thy love will stay,
And husband nature's riches from expense,
And all things turns to fair, that eyes can see!
And yet this time removed was summer's time,
And thou away, the very birds are mute.
And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair,
And to his robbery had annexed thy breath,
And gives thy pen both skill and argument.
And make time's spoils despised everywhere.
And to be praised of ages yet to be.
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
And more, much more than in my verse can sit,
And in this change is my invention spent,
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme,
And for they looked but with divining eyes,
And the sad augurs mock their own presage,
And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
And made my self a motley to the view,
And worse essays proved thee my best of love.
And almost thence my nature is subdued
And that which governs me to go about,
And that your love taught it this alchemy?
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up,
And to his palate doth prepare the cup.
And given to time your own dear-purchased right,
And on just proof surmise, accumulate,
And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness,  
And brought to medicine a healthful state
And ruined love when it is built anew  
And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent.
And for that sorrow, which I then did feel,
And I a tyrant have no leisure taken
And soon to you, as you to me then tendered
And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed,
And rather make them born to our desire,  
And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
And her quietus is to render thee.
And beauty slandered with a bastard shame,
And situation with those dancing chips,
And in some perfumes is there more delight,
And yet by heaven I think my love as rare,
And to be sure that is not false I swear,
And thence this slander as I think proceeds.
And truly not the morning sun of heaven  
And suit thy pity like in every part.
And all they foul that thy complexion lack.
And my next self thou harder hast engrossed,
And yet thou wilt, for I being pent in thee,
And I my self am mortgaged to thy will,
And sue a friend, came debtor for my sake,
And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in over-plus,
And in my will no fair acceptance shine?
And in abundance addeth to his store,
And will thy soul knows is admitted there,
And then thou lov'st me for my name is Will.
And to this false plague are they now transferred.
And wherefore say not I that I am old?
And age in love, loves not to have years told.
And in our faults by lies we flattered be.
And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
And in my madness might speak ill of thee,
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving,
And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,
And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind.
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil:
And whether that my angel be turned fiend,
And taught it thus anew to greet:
And saved my life saying 'not you'.
And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
And death once dead, there's no more dying then.
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest,
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
And all my honest faith in thee is lost.
And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove,
And thither hied a sad distempered guest.
And so the general of hot desire,
And these great tears grace his remembrance more
And think to wed it, he is so above me.
And yet I know him a notorious liar,
And show what we alone must think, which never
And Florence is denied before he comes;
And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,
And gave this sentence then:
And put you in the catalogue of those
And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,
And manifest experience had collected  
And pray God's blessing into thy attempt.
And is enough for both.
And find your Grace in health.
And that at my bidding you could so stand up.
And ask'd thee mercy for't.  
And write to her a love-line.
And not be all day neither.                       Exit LAFEU
And of his old experience th' only darling,
And, hearing your high Majesty is touch'd
And what impossibility would slay
And well deserv'd. Not helping, death's my fee;
And urge her to a present answer back;
And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense
And writ as little beard.
And to imperial Love, that god most high,
And these breed honour. That is honour's scorn
And is not like the sire. Honours thrive
And tell her she is thine; to whom I promise
And be perform'd to-night. The solemn feast
And wherefore I am fled; write to the King
And pleasure drown the brim.
And make this haste as your own good proceeding,
And rather muse than ask why I entreat you;
And my appointments have in them a need
And more thirsts after.
And all the honours that can fly from us
And, after some dispatch in hand at court,
And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains.
And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?
And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?
And though I kill him not, I am the cause
And angels offic'd all. I will be gone,
And Fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,
And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
And brokes with all that can in such a suit
And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,
And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature;
And would not put my reputation now
And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
And lawful meaning in a lawful act;
And I shall lose my life for want of language.
And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on
And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,
And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,
And now you should be as your mother was
And mock us with our bareness.
And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
And I'll be bid by thee.
And on your finger in the night I'll put
Another ring, that what in time proceeds
And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this:
And answer 'Thanks.' I duly am inform'd
And by the leave of my good lord the King,
And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!
And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;  
And therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,
And aid me with that store of power you have
And I beseech your Majesty to make it
And watch'd the time to shoot.
And deeper than oblivion do we bury
And ev'ry hair that's on 't, Helen, that's dead,
And mak'st conjectural fears to come into me
And yet I know not- thou didst hate her deadly,
And she is dead; which nothing, but to close
And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,
And therefore know how far I may be pitied.
And both shall cease, without your remedy.  
And was a common gamester to the camp.
And boarded her i' th' wanton way of youth.
And I had that which any inferior might
And give me mine again.
And he shall surety me. But for this lord
And at that time he got his wife with child.
And now behold the meaning.
And, look you, here's your letter. This it says:
And are by me with child,' etc. This is done.
And is become the bellows and the fan
And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,
And fertile every wish, a million.
And get her leave to part. For not alone
And not a serpent's poison. Say our pleasure,
And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
And that which most with you should safe my going,
And give true evidence to his love, which stands
An honourable trial.
And I am all forgotten!
And all the gods go with you! Upon your sword
And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.
And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
And so rebel to judgment.
And it appears he is belov'd of those
And the ebb'd man, ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love,
And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
And shall become you well, to entreat your captain
And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,
And have my learning from some true reports
And make the wars alike against my stomach,
And then when poisoned hours had bound me up
And all great fears, which now import their dangers,
And sway our great designs!
And do invite you to my sister's view,
And what they undid did.
And made their bends adornings. At the helm
And made a gap in nature.
And for his ordinary pays his heart
And, having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,
And, breathless, pow'r breathe forth.
And in our sports my better cunning faints
And though I make this marriage for my peace,
And say 'Ah ha! Y'are caught.'
And make thy fortunes proud. The blow thou hadst
And I will boot thee with what gift beside
An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell
And be undone by 'em!                         Exit MESSENGER
And we shall talk before we fight.
And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
And am well studied for a liberal thanks
And seal'd between us.  
And I have heard Apollodorus carried-
And well am like to do, for I perceive
And shortly comes to harvest.
And hear me speak a word.
And though you think me poor, I am the man
And when we are put off, fall to their throats.
And not have spoke on't. In me 'tis villainy:
And it grows fouler.
And celebrate our drink?
Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.
And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.
And neither way inclines.
And give you to the gods.
And serving you so long!
And throw between them all the food thou hast,
And threats the throat of that his officer
And all the unlawful issue that their lust
And did deserve his change. For what I have conquer'd
And other of his conquer'd kingdoms,
And his affairs come to me on the wind.
And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;
And ever welcome to us.
And gives his potent regiment to a trull
And say'st it is not fit.

And so should you.

And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship.

And so proceed accordingly.                           Exeunt
Another part of the plain
And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
And make your peace with Caesar.
And thou shouldst tow me after. O'er my spirit
And palter in the shifts of lowness, who
An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither
And in our name, what she requires; add more,
And what thou think'st his very action speaks
And leave his navy gazing.
And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
And answer me declin'd, sword against sword,
Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdu'd
And earns a place i' th' story.
And put yourself under his shroud,
And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am
Antony yet.
And whine aloud for mercy. Take him hence.
And by a gem of women, to be abus'd
And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
And plighter of high hearts! O that I were
And to proclaim it civilly were like
And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,
And poison it in the source, and the first stone
And fight maliciously. For when mine hours
And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
And feast the army; we have store to do't,
And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!          Exeunt
And kings have been your fellows.
And all of you clapp'd up together in
An Antony, that I might do you service
And suffer'd my command.
And the gods yield you for't!
And I, an ass, am onion-ey'd. For shame!
And drown consideration.                              Exeunt
And full of purpose.
And go to't with delight.
And at the port expect you.
And worthy shameful check it were, to stand
And leave his master Antony. For this pains
And feel I am so most. O Antony,
And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind.
And let the Queen know of our gests. To-morrow,
An armour all of gold; it was a king's.
And drink carouses to the next day's fate,
And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,
And look on their endeavour.                          Exeunt
And hold our best advantage.                          Exeunt
And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony
And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee
And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians;
And with those hands that grasp'd the heaviest club
And word it, prithee, piteously. Hence, Mardian,
And bring me how he takes my death. To th' monument!
And mock our eyes with air. Thou hast seen these signs;
And that she has discharg'd. What thou wouldst do  
And we must sleep. That thou depart'st hence safe
And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze.
And all the haunt be ours.- Come, Eros, Eros!
And have my thanks for all.           Exeunt, hearing ANTONY
Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian; help, Iras, help;
And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour
And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little.
And welcome, welcome! Die where thou hast liv'd.
And there is nothing left remarkable
And does the meanest chares. It were for me
And make death proud to take us. Come, away;
And citizens to their dens. The death of Antony
And with your speediest bring us what she says,
And how you find her.
And bids thee study on what fair demands
And show me to the shouting varletry
And hang me up in chains!
And he hath sent for thee. For the Queen,
An Antony were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself
And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.
And we are for the dark.
And forc'd to drink their vapour.
And when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave
Antony call. I see him rouse himself
And golden Phoebus never be beheld
And on the sudden dropp'd.
And bear her women from the monument.
And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see
And all the world was of my father's mind;
And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,
And pity her for her good father's sake;
And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
And get you from our court.  
And wheresoe'er we went, like Juno's swans,
And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
And in the greatness of my word, you die.
And do not seek to take your charge upon you,
And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
And never stir assailants.
And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
And get our jewels and our wealth together;  
And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
And this our life, exempt from public haunt,
And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
And never stays to greet him. 'Ay,' quoth Jaques
And she believes, wherever they are gone,
And let not search and inquisition quail
And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?
And you within it. If he fail of that,
And unregarded age in corners thrown.
And having that do choke their service up
And ere we have thy youthful wages spent
And faints for succour.
And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,
And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.
And little recks to find the way to heaven
And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
And willingly could waste my time in it.
And buy it with your gold right suddenly.             Exeunt
Another part of the forest
And turn his merry note
And loves to live i' th' sun,
And pleas'd with what he gets,
An if he will come to me.
And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,
And then he drew a dial from his poke,
And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear
And I did laugh sans intermission
An hour by his dial. O noble fool!  
And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
And they that are most galled with my folly,
And all th' embossed sores and headed evils
And know some nurture. But forbear, I say;
And therefore put I on the countenance
And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church,
And sat at good men's feasts, and wip'd our eyes
And therefore sit you down in gentleness,
And take upon command what help we have
And give it food. There is an old poor man  
And we will nothing waste till you return.
And all the men and women merely players;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
And shining morning face, creeping like snail  
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
And let him feed.
And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
And let me all your fortunes understand.              Exeunt
And let my officers of such a nature
And thou, thrice-crowned Queen of Night, survey
And in their barks my thoughts I'll character,
And I to live and die her slave.'
And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
Another part of the forest
And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.
And out of you she sees herself more proper
And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love;
And be not proud; though all the world could see,
And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
And I in such a poverty of grace,
And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
And, now I am rememb'red, scorn'd at me.
And thou shalt bear it; wilt thou, Silvius?
And thy father bore it.
And here much Orlando!
And play the swaggerer. Bear this, bear all.
And turn'd into the extremity of love.
And by him seal up thy mind,
And then I'll study how to die.'
And browner than her brother.' Are not you
And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
And mark what object did present itself.
And high top bald with dry antiquity,
And with indented glides did slip away
And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
And he did render him the most unnatural
And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
And, after some small space, being strong at heart,
And so am I for Phebe.
And so am I for Phebe.
And so am I for Phebe.
And therefore take the present time,
And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
And to the skirts of this wild wood he came,
And all their lands restor'd to them again
And after, every of this happy number,
And fall into our rustic revelry.
And thrown into neglect the pompous court.
And by the doom of death end woes and all.
And for what cause thou cam'st to Ephesus.
And by me, had not our hap been bad.
And the great care of goods at random left,
And soon and safe arrived where I was.
And, which was strange, the one so like the other
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
And this it was, for other means was none:
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us;
And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,
And, by the benefit of his wished light,
And in our sight they three were taken up
And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;
And happy were I in my timely death,
And passed sentence may not be recall'd
And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
And, not being able to buy out his life,
And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
And then return and sleep within mine inn;
And go indeed, having so good a mean.
And then go to my inn and dine with me?
And afterward consort you till bed time.
And wander up and down to view the city.
And strike you home without a messenger.
And tell me how thou hast dispos'd thy charge.
And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.
And many such-like liberties of sin;
And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner;
And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.
And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;
And make a common of my serious hours.
And fashion your demeanour to my looks,
And take unmingled thence that drop again
And that this body, consecrate to thee,
And hurl the name of husband in my face,
And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow,
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring,
And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
And in this mist at all adventures go.
And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
And charg'd him with a thousand marks in gold,
And that I did deny my wife and house.
And so tell your master.
And draw within the compass of suspect
And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner;
And, about evening, come yourself alone
And that supposed by the common rout
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
And in despite of mirth mean to be merry.
And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made.
And let her read it in thy looks at board;
And as a bed I'll take them, and there he;
And in that glorious supposition think
And, I think, if my breast had not been made of faith,
An if the wind blow any way from shore,
And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.
And soon at supper-time I'll visit you,
And then receive my money for the chain.
And since I have not much importun'd you;
And in the instant that I met with you
And buy a rope's end; that will I bestow
And with you take the chain, and bid my wife
And I, to blame, have held him here too long.
And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,
And told thee to what purpose and what end.
And teach your ears to list me with more heed.
And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone.
And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.
And bring thy master home immediately.
And every one doth call me by my name.
And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,
And therewithal took measure of my body.
And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.
And here we wander in illusions.
And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
And for the same he promis'd me a chain;
And tell his wife that, being lunatic,
And will not lightly trust the messenger.
And I will please you what you will demand.
And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight.
And I denied to enter in my house?
And, yielding to him, humours well his frenzy.
And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?
And art confederate with a damned pack
And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.
And, not without some scandal to yourself,
And bear him home for his recovery.
And much different from the man he was;
And thereof comes it that his head is light.
And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
And at her heels a huge infectious troop
And it shall privilege him from your hands
And will have no attorney but myself;
And therefore let me have him home with me.
And ill it doth beseem your holiness
And never rise until my tears and prayers
And take perforce my husband from the Abbess.
Anon, I'm sure, the Duke himself in person
Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
And with his mad attendant and himself,
And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us,
And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
And I to thee engag'd a prince's word,
And bid the Lady Abbess come to me,
And ever, as it blaz'd, they threw on him
And sure, unless you send some present help,
And that is false thou dost report to us.
And now he's there, past thought of human reason.
And in his company that gentleman.
And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
And in a dark and dankish vault at home
And thereupon I drew my sword on you,
And then you fled into this abbey here,
And this is false you burden me withal.
And pay the sum that may deliver me.
And is not that your bondman Dromio?
And careful hours with time's deformed hand
And all the conduits of my blood froze up,
And so of these. Which is the natural man,
And which the spirit? Who deciphers them?
And gain a husband by his liberty.
And speak unto the same Aemilia!
And the twin Dromio, all were taken up;
And me they left with those of Epidamnum.
And these two Dromios, one in semblance-
Antipholus, thou cam'st from Corinth first?
And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,
And Dromio my man did bring them me.
And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,
And thereupon these ERRORS are arose.
And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes;
And all that are assembled in this place
And we shall make full satisfaction.
And you the calendars of their nativity,
And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.
And, mutually participate, did minister
And, through the cranks and offices of man,
And leave me but the bran.' What say you to' t?
And you the mutinous members; for, examine
And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness  
And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye?
And call him noble that was now your hate,
And feebling such as stand not in their liking  
And let me use my sword, I'd make a quarry
And a petition granted them- a strange one,
And make bold power look pale- they threw their caps
And were I anything but what I am,
And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
And know how we proceed.
And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
And tread upon his neck.
And he shall feel mine edge.
And make my wars on you. Look to't. Come on;  
Another alarum. The Volsces fly, and MARCIUS follows
And when it bows stand'st up. Thou art left, Marcius;
And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle;
And then I came away.  
And bring thy news so late?
And tapers burn'd to bedward.
And that you not delay the present, but,
And balms applied to you, yet dare I never
And that his country's dearer than himself;
And follow Marcius.           [They all shout and wave their  
And four shall quickly draw out my command,
And the gods doom him after!
And made what work I pleas'd. 'Tis not my blood
And, gladly quak'd, hear more; where the dull tribunes,
And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses-
And stand upon my common part with those
An overture for th' wars. No more, I say.
And when my face is fair you shall perceive
And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity. I request you
And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
And mothers that lack sons.
And y'are welcome all.
And I could laugh; I am light and heavy. Welcome!
And the buildings of my fancy; only
And gave him graceful posture.
And the desire of the nobles.
And carry with us ears and eyes for th' time,
An o'erpress'd Roman and i' th' consul's view
And struck him on his knee. In that day's feats,
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since  
And by his rare example made the coward
And fell below his stem. His sword, death's stamp,
And with a sudden re-enforcement struck
And to the battle came he; where he did
And look'd upon things precious as they were
And keep their teeth clean. So, here comes a brace.
And mountainous error be too highly heap'd
Anon do meet the Senate.
And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
And pass'd him unelected.
And, on a safer judgment, all revoke
And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
And Censorinus, nobly named so,
And presently, when you have drawn your number,
And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,  
And straight disclaim their tongues? What are your offices?
And make your channel his? If he have power,
And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
And throw their power i' th' dust.
And follow to thine answer.
And bury all which yet distinctly ranges
And temp'rately proceed to what you would  
And bear him to the rock.
And manhood is call'd foolery when it stands  
And, being angry, does forget that ever
And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
And we their hands.
And what is left, to lose it by his country
And sack great Rome with Romans.
And you will rather show our general louts
And thus far having stretch'd it- here be with them-
And throw't against the wind. To th' market-place!
And by my body's action teach my mind
And that the spoil got on the Antiates
And when they hear me say 'It shall be so
And power i' th' truth o' th' cause.
And not our streets with war!
And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
And treasure of my loins. Then if I would
And here remain with your uncertainty!
And occupations perish!
And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime General,
And we of thee; so, if the time thrust forth
And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what- yet go!
And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?
And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go.
Antium. Before AUFIDIUS' house
And interjoin their issues. So with me:
Antium. AUFIDIUS' house
And harsh in sound to thine.  
And witness of the malice and displeasure
An suffer'd me by th' voice of slaves to be
And make my misery serve thy turn. So use it
And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
And say ''Tis true,' I'd not believe them more
And scarr'd the moon with splinters; here I clip
And wak'd half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
And take our friendly senators by th' hands,
And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
And quietness of the people, which before
And so would do, were he more angry at it.
And with the deepest malice of the war
And durst not once peep out.
And three examples of the like hath been
And beat the messenger who bids beware
And vows revenge as spacious as between
And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
And therein show'd fike enemies.
And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
And is Aufidius with him? You are they
And not a hair upon a soldier's head
And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
And show no sign of fear.
And you are dark'ned in this action, sir,
And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
And the nobility of Rome are his;
And power, unto itself most commendable,
And still to nose th' offence.
And this brave fellow too- we are the grains:
And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me.
And then I'll set upon him.
And cannot lose your way.
And with our fair entreaties haste them on.           Exeunt
And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks
And would have sent it. Another word, Menenius,
And cannot now accept. To grace him only,  
And knew no other kin.
And the most noble mother of the world  
And hangs on Dian's temple- dear Valeria!
And saving those that eye thee!
And state of bodies would bewray what life
An evident calamity, though we had
And bear the palm for having bravely shed
And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
And spurn me back; but if it he not so,
And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold's!
And then I'll speak a little.
And, sir, it is no little thing to make
And hale him up and down; all swearing if
And help the joy.                                     Exeunt
And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them.
And with his charity slain.  
And my pretext to strike at him admits
And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!
And had no welcomes home; but he returns
And trouble not the peace.
And mourn you for him. Let him be regarded
And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.
And therefore banish'd- is a creature such
And had, besides this gentleman in question,  
And in's spring became a harvest, liv'd in court-
And I shall here abide the hourly shot
And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,
And sear up my embracements from a next
And bless the good remainders of the court!
And did avoid a puttock.
And pen her up.
And had no help of anger; they were parted
And questioned'st every sail; if he should write,
And I not have it, 'twere a paper lost,
And that was all?
And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
An enemy to my son.- How now, Pisanio!  
And will not trust one of her malice with
And every day that comes comes comes to
And the remembrancer of her to hold
And greets your Highness dearly.         [Presents a letter]  
An eminent monsieur that, it seems, much loves  
And hear him mock the Frenchman. But heavens know
And will continue fast to your affection,
And yet of moment too, for it concerns
And I am something curious, being strange,
And pawn mine honour for their safety. Since
And truly yielded you. You're very welcome.           Exeunt
And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,
And if thou canst awake by four o' th' clock,
And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!
And be her sense but as a monument,
And Phoebus 'gins arise,
And winking Mary-buds begin
And then she's yours.
And therein you are senseless.
And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,
And scarce can spare them.
And am so near the lack of charity
And though it be allowed in meaner parties-
And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,
And be false with them.
And ring is yours. If not, the foul opinion
And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for
And this you might have heard of here, by me
And now 'tis up again. It must be married
And yet enrich'd it too. She gave it me, and said
And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won.
And so I hope he came by't. Back my ring.
And by a stranger! No, he hath enjoy'd her.
Another stain, as big as hell can hold,
And I will kill thee if thou dost deny
And that most venerable man which I
And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with
And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,
And his succession granted Rome a tribute,
And Britons strut with courage.  
And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike;
And our return, to excuse. But first, how get hence.
And keep their impious turbans on without
And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
And often to our comfort shall we find
And sing our bondage freely.
And felt them knowingly- the art o' th' court,
And hath as oft a sland'rous epitaph
And when a soldier was the theme, my name
And left me bare to weather.
And we will fear no poison, which attends
And thus I set my foot on's neck'; even then
And every day do honour to her grave.
And he's at some hard point. Speak, man; thy tongue
And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing
And cry myself awake? That's false to's bed,
And for I am richer than to hang by th' walls
And if I do not by thy hand, thou art
And that will well confirm it.
And with what imitation you can borrow
And, doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad-
And fit you to your manhood. May the gods
And am right sorry that I must report ye
And strokes death to her.
And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,
An earthly paragon! Behold divineness
And such a welcome as I'd give to him
And that the legions now in Gallia are
And a demand who is't shall die, I'd say
And sauc'd our broths as Juno had been sick,
And he her dieter.
And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine  
An arm as big as thine, a heart as big?
And on the gates of Lud's Town set your heads.
And burst of speaking, were as his. I am absolute
And set them on Lud's Town.
And tell the fishes he's the Queen's son, Cloten.
And put us to our answer.
And praise myself for charity.                          Exit
And make him stoop to th' vale. 'Tis wonder
And brings the dire occasion in his arms
Answer'd my steps too loud.
And worms will not come to thee.
And do not play in wench-like words with that
And not protract with admiration what
And let us, Polydore, though now our voices
And though he came our enemy, remember
And though you took his life, as being our foe,
And renowned be thy grave!
And cook to honest creatures. But 'tis not so;
And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,
And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?  
And cordial to me, have I not found it
And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,  
And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is here
And on it said a century of prayers,  
And leaving so his service, follow you,
And rather father thee than master thee.
And make him with our pikes and partisans
And will no doubt be found.
And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not
And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,
And make them dread it, to the doer's thrift.
And make me blest to obey. I am brought hither  
Another part of the field
And but the backs of Britons seen, an flying,
An honest one, I warrant, who deserv'd
And vent it for a mock'ry? Here is one:
And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,
And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!
And to become the geck and scorn
And potent injuries.
And from thy justice fly.
And happier much by his affliction made.
And so, away; no farther with your din
And so I am awake. Poor wretches, that depend
And yet are steep'd in favours; so am I,
And not o' th' court of Britain.
And but she spoke it dying, I would not
And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!
And spare no blood beside.
And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore  
And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,
And yet I know thou wilt.
And lend my best attention. What's thy name?
And not dispraising whom we prais'd- therein
And then a mind put in't, either our brags
And she alone were cold; whereat I, wretch,
And would so, had it been a carbuncle
And, to be brief, my practice so prevail'd
And am right glad he is not standing here
And take him from our presence.
And let it be confiscate all, so soon
And think they are my sons, are none of mine;
And blood of your begetting.
And when came you to serve our Roman captive?
And your three motives to the battle, with
And all the other by-dependences,
And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye
And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.
And here the bracelet of the truest princess
And deal with others better.
Answering the letter of the oracle,
And to the Roman empire, promising
And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
And in the temple of great Jupiter
And I am sick at heart.
And will not let belief take hold of him
And let us once again assail your ears,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
And foreign mart for implements of war;
And carriage of the article design'd,
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
And prologue to the omen coming on,
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
An understanding simple and unschool'd;
And with no less nobility of love
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
And vanish'd from our sight.
And we did think it writ down in our duty
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
And keep you in the rear of your affection,  
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
And recks not his own rede.
And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
And these few precepts in thy memory
And they in France of the best rank and station
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
And it must follow, as the night the day,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
And that in way of caution- I must tell you
And with a larger tether may he walk
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
And to the manner born, it is a custom
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
And there assume some other, horrible form
And draw you into madness? Think of it.
And hears it roar beneath.
And makes each petty artire in this body
And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
And each particular hair to stand an end
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed  
And prey on garbage.
And in the porches of my ears did pour
And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,  
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
And thy commandment all alone shall live
And so, without more circumstance at all,
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
And lay your hands again upon my sword.
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
And with a look so piteous in purport
And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
And to the last bended their light on me.
And leads the will to desperate undertakings
And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
And sure I am two men there are not living
And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
And I beseech you instantly to visit
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
And I do think- or else this brain of mine
And his commission to employ those soldiers,
And at our more consider'd time we'll read,  
Answer, and think upon this business.
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
And more above, hath his solicitings,
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
And all we mourn for.  
And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
And passion in the gods.'
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
And, as I think, they have already order
And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
And drive his purpose on to these delights.
And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
And pious action we do sugar o'er  
And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
And thus the native hue of resolution
And enterprises of great pith and moment
And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
And could of men distinguish, her election
And my imaginations are as foul
And after we will both our judgments join
And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
And thirty dozed moons with borrowed sheen
And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
And never come mischance between us twain!
And do such bitter business as the day
And he to England shall along with you.
And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
And tell you what I know.
And, like a man to double business bound,
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.
And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes
And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame  
And reason panders will.
And there I see such black and grained spots
And put it in his pocket!  
And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
And I the matter will reword; which madness
And do not spread the compost on the weeds
And live the purer with the other half,
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
And when you are desirous to be blest,
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
And break your own neck down.
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
And blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet
And in this brainish apprehension kills
And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
And let them know both what we mean to do
And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
And bear it to the chapel.
And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
And let him know so.
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
And his sandal shoon.
And I a maid at your window,
And dupp'd the chamber door,
An thou hadst not come to my bed.'
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
And, as the world were now but to begin,
Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
And for my means, I'll husband them so well
And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
And am most sensibly in grief for it,
And in his grave rain'd many a tear.
And will he not come again?
And will he not come again?
And we cast away moan.
And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi', you.
And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
And we shall jointly labour with your soul
And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
And do't the speedier that you may direct me
And You must put me in your heart for friend,
And not where I had aim'd them.
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-  
And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
And for his death no wind
And call it accident.
And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
And they can well on horseback; but this gallant  
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
And gem of all the nation.
And gave you such a masterly report
And for your rapier most especially,
And that I see, in passages of proof,
And nothing is at a like goodness still;
And hath abatements and delays as many  
And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
And set a double varnish on the fame
And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
And that our drift look through our bad performance.
And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
And hath shipped me intil the land,
And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh  
And not have strew'd thy grave.
And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
And thus a while the fit will work on him.
Anon, as patient as the female dove
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
And many such-like as's of great charge,
And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
And hurt my brother.
And will not wrong it.
And will this brother's wager frankly play.
And in the cup an union shall he throw
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
And our affairs from England come too late.  
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
And call the noblest to the audience.
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
And furious close of civil butchery,
And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go.
And many limits of the charge set down
And shape of likelihood the news was told;
And pride of their contention did take horse,
And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
And is not this an honourable spoil?
And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!
And for this cause awhile we must neglect
And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
And pay the debt I never promised,
And, like bright metal on a sullen ground,
And you have found me, for accordingly
And therefore lost that title of respect
And that same greatness too which our own hands
And majesty might never yet endure
And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
Answer'd neglectingly, I know not what-
And talk so like a waiting gentlewoman
And telling me the sovereignest thing on earth
And that it was great pity, so it was,
And I beseech you, let not his report
And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
And tell him so; for I will else my heart,
And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,
And when I urg'd the ransom once again
And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,
And then it was when the unhappy King
And for his sake wear the detested blot
And plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?
And shall it in more shame be further spoken
And now, I will unclasp a secret book,
And to your quick-conceiving discontents
And let them grapple. O, the blood more stirs
And pluck up drowned honour by the locks,
And lend no ear unto my purposes.
And in his ear I'll holloa 'Mortimer.'
And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales-
And would be glad he met with some mischance,
And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin'-
And make the Douglas' son your only mean
And only stays but to behold the face
And then the power of Scotland and of York
And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,
And see already how he doth begin
An the Prince and Poins be not two arrant cowards, there's no
And lards the lean earth as he walks along.
And start so often when thou sit'st alone?
And given my treasures and my rights of thee
And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars,
And all the currents of a heady fight.
And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,
And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,  
And I must know it, else he loves me not.
An if thou wilt not tell my all things true.
And pass them current too. Gods me, my horse!  
And when I am a-horseback, I will swear
And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.
And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee
And so let me entreat you leave the house.
And our induction full of prosperous hope.
And uncle Worcester. A plague upon it!
And not in fear of your nativity.
And all the courses of my life do show
And bring him out that is but woman's son
And hold me pace in deep experiments.
And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.
And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him
And all the fertile land within that bound,  
And our indentures tripartite are drawn;
And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
And in my conduct shall your ladies come,
And cuts me from the best of all my land
And here the smug and sliver Trent shall run
And on this north side win this cape of land;
And then he runs straight and even.
And gave the tongue a helpful ornament-
And I am glad of it with all my heart!
And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,
And of a dragon and a finless fish,
And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
And wondrous affable, and as bountiful
And curbs himself even of his natural scope
And since your coming hither have done enough
And that's the dearest grace it renders you-
And that's a feeling disputation.
And rest your gentle head upon her lap,
And she will sing the song that pleaseth you
And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep,
And those musicians that shall play to you
And straight they shall be here. Sit, and attend.
And 'tis no marvel, be is so humorous.
And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths
And such protest of pepper gingerbread
And then to horse immediately.
And hold their level with thy princely heart?
And pardon on lily true submission.
And art almost an alien to the hearts
And left me in reputeless banishment,
And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,
And dress'd myself in such humility
And won by rareness such solemnity.
And gave his countenance, against his name,
And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;
And even as I was then is Percy now.
And, Being no more in debt to years than thou,
And military title capital
And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,
And God forgive them that so much have sway'd
And, in the closing of some glorious day,
And stain my favours in a bloody mask,
And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,
And your unthought of Harry chance to meet.
And I will call hall to so strict account
And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
And either they or we must lower lie.                [Exit.]
And at the time of my departure thence
And that his friends by deputation could not
And yet, in faith, it is not! His present want
And think how such an apprehension
And breed a kind of question in our cause.
And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence
And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside
And bid it pass?
And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;
And vaulted with such ease into his seat
And witch the world with noble horsemanship.
And to the fire-ey'd maid of smoky war
And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,
And I dare well maintain it with my life-
And now their pride and mettle is asleep,
And pardon absolute for yourself and these
And when he was not six-and-twenty strong,
And when he heard him swear and vow to God
And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform
And in the neck of that task'd the whole state;
And in conclusion drove us to seek out
And In the morning early shall mine uncle
And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,  
And comes not in, overrul'd by prophecies-
And there is my Lord of Worcester, and a head
And many moe corrivals and dear men
And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed.
And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him.
And by his hollow whistling in the leaves
And made us doff our easy robes of peace  
And move in that obedient orb again
And be no more an exhal'd meteor,
And yet I must remember you, my lord,  
And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,
And such a flood of greatness fell on you-
And the contrarious winds that held the King  
And from this swarm of fair advantages
And, being fed by us, you us'd us so
And violation of all faith and troth
And never yet did insurrection want
And so I hear he doth account me too.
And will to save the blood on either side,
And, will they take the offer of our grace,
And they shall do their office. So be gone.  
And God befriend us as our cause is just!
And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,
And an adopted name of privilege-
And on his father's. We did train him on;
And, his corruption being taken from us,
And Westmoreland, that was engag'd, did bear it;
And, nephew, challeng'd you to single fight.
And that no man might draw short breath to-day  
And, which became him like a prince indeed,
And chid his truant youth with such a grace
An if we live, we live to tread on kings;  
And by that music let us all embrace;
And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
Another part of the field.
And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive
And rebels' arms triumph in massacres!
And not the very King. I have two boys  
And yet, in faith, thou bearest thee like a king.
And thus I win thee.
And so hath Clifton. I'll to Clifton straight.
And show'd thou mak'st some tender of my life,
And sav'd the treacherous labour of your son.
And all the budding honours on thy crest
And time, that takes survey of all the world,
And food for-                                        [Dies.]
And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself
Another part of the field.
And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?
And I embrace this fortune patiently,
And falling from a hill,he was so bruis'd
And since this business so fair is done,
And who but Rumour, who but only I,
And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe
And of so easy and so plain a stop  
And that the King before the Douglas' rage
And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,
And not a man of them brings other news
And he himself will answer.
And bears down all before him.
And, in the fortune of my lord your son,
And Westmoreland, and Stafford, fled the field;
And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,
And he is furnish'd with no certainties
And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.  
And, bending forward, struck his armed heels
And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;
And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.  
And I will take it as a sweet disgrace
And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.
And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,
And as the thing that's heavy in itself
And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.
And as the wretch whose fever-weak'ned joints,
And let this world no longer be a stage
And darkness be the burier of the dead!
And summ'd the account of chance before you said
And yet we ventur'd, for the gain propos'd
And since we are o'erset, venture again.
And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,
And doth enlarge his rising with the blood
And more and less do flock to follow him.
And, my most noble friends, I pray you all
And first, Lord Marshal, what say you to it?
And our supplies live largely in the hope
And so, with great imagination
And, winking, leapt into destruction.
And when we see the figure of the house,
And set another up- should we survey
And waste for churlish winter's tyranny.
And one against Glendower; perforce a third
And come against us in full puissance
And publish the occasion of our arms.
An habitation giddy and unsure
And being now trimm'd in thine own desires,
And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,
And howl'st to find it. What trust is in these times?
And take thou this!' O thoughts of men accurs'd!
And didst thou not kiss me, and bid me fetch the thirty
And be, like them, to Percy troublesome.
And but my going nothing can redeem it.
And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,
And find me worse provided.
And never shall have length of life enough
And hollow pamper'd jades of Asia,
And Troiant Greeks? Nay, rather damn them with
And there are twenty weak and wearied posts
And asking every one for Sir John Falstaff.
And drop upon our bare unarmed heads.
And well consider of them. Make good speed.        Exit page
And steep my senses in forgetfulness?
And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,
And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody?
And in the visitation of the winds,
And in the calmest and most stillest night,
And with what danger, near the heart of it.
And see the revolution of the times
And changes fill the cup of alteration
And laid his love and life under my foot;
And the division of our amity.
And weak beginning lie intreasured.
And, by the necessary form of this,
And that same word even now cries out on us.
And these unseasoned hours perforce must ad
And, were these inward wars once out of hand,
And this same half-fac'd fellow, Shadow- give me this man. He
And fearful meeting of their opposite.
And dash themselves to pieces.
And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number
And countenanc'd by boys and beggary-
And with our surfeiting and wanton hours
And we must bleed for it; of which disease
And purge th' obstructions which begin to stop
And find our griefs heavier than our offences.
And are enforc'd from our most quiet there
And have the summary of all our griefs,
And might by no suit gain our audience:
And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?
And suffer the condition of these times
And you shall say, indeed, it is the time,
And not the King, that doth you injuries.  
And then that Henry Bolingbroke and he,
And the loud trumpet blowing them together-
And bless'd and grac'd indeed more than the King.
And it proceeds from policy, not love.
And present execution of our wills
And knit our powers to the arm of peace.
And either end in peace- which God so frame!-
And good from bad find no partition.
And therefore will he wipe his tables clean,
And keep no tell-tale to his memory
And hangs resolv'd correction in the arm
And therefore be assur'd, my good Lord Marshal,
Another part of the forest
And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.
And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,
And our dull workings. O, who shall believe
And both against the peace of heaven and him
And true obedience, of this madness cur'd,
And so success of mischief shall be born,
And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up
And swear here, by the honour of my blood,
And some about him have too lavishly
And thereupon I drink unto your Grace.
And neither party loser.
And let our army be discharged too.
And, good my lord, so please you let our trains
And, ere they be dismiss'd, let them march by.
And you, Lord Archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray,
Another part of the forest
An I had but a belly of any indifferency, I were simply the most
And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords.
And we with sober speed will follow you.
And draw no swords but what are sanctified.
And everything lies level to our wish.
And pause us till these rebels, now afoot,
And noble offices thou mayst effect
And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,
And he, the noble image of my youth,
And rotten times that you shall look upon
And, when they stand against you, may they fall
And takes away the stomach- such are the rich
And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy.
And the old folk, Time's doting chronicles,
And helps to end me. See, sons, what things you are!
And thou wilt have me die assur'd of it.
And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
And to the English court assemble now,
And he that wears the crown immortally
And found no course of breath within your Majesty,
And never live to show th' incredulous world
And dead almost, my liege, to think you were-
And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending
And make me as the poorest vassal is,
And hear, I think, the very latest counsel
And I had many living to upbraid
And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,
And by whose power I well might lodge a fear
And grant it may with thee in true peace live!
And to our purposes he lives no more.
And I dare swear you borrow not that face
And never shall you see that I will beg
And tell him who hath sent me after him.
And wear it in my heart. Why, then, be sad;
And in th' administration of his law,
And struck me in my very seat of judgment;
And did commit you. If the deed were ill,
And mock your workings in a second body.
And then imagine me taking your part
And, in your power, soft silencing your son.
And, as you are a king, speak in your state
And I do wish your honours may increase
And not less happy, having such a son
And I will stoop and humble my intents
And, Princes all, believe me, I beseech you,
And with his spirits sadly I survive,
And flow henceforth in formal majesty.
And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,
And- God consigning to my good intents-
And praise God for the merry year;
And lusty lads roam here and there,
And ever among so merrily.
And welcome merry Shrove-tide.
And drink unto the leman mine;
And a merry heart lives long-a.
And dub me knight.
And helter-skelter have I rode to thee;
And tidings do I bring, and lucky joys,
And golden times, and happy news of price.
And shall good news be baffled?
And make thee rage.
And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!
And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,
And make imaginary puissance;
And, to relief of lazars and weak age,
And to the coffers of the King, beside,
And whipp'd th' offending Adam out of him,
And, all-admiring, with an inward wish
And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears
And never noted in him any study,
Any retirement, any sequestration
And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
And so the Prince obscur'd his contemplation
And therefore we must needs admit the means  
And in regard of causes now in hand,
And generally to the crown and seat of France,
And make you long become it!
And justly and religiously unfold  
And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,
And rather choose to hide them in a net
And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,
And let another half stand laughing by,
And with your puissant arm renew their feats.
And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.
And she a mourning widow of her nobles,
And make her chronicle as rich with praise
And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.
And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.
And yours, the noble sinews of our power,
And bids you be advis'd there's nought in France
And therefore, living hence, did give ourself
And plodded like a man for working-days;
And tell the pleasant Prince this mock of his  
And some are yet ungotten and unborn
And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies;
And hides a sword from hilts unto the point
And by their hands this grace of kings must die-
And thence to France shall we convey you safe
And bring you back, charming the narrow seas  
And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy;
And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!
And flashing fire will follow.
And from the powd'ring tub of infamy
And liquor likewise will I give to thee,
And friendship shall combine, and brotherhood.
And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts.
And shall forget the office of our hand  
And labour shall refresh itself with hope,
And on his more advice we pardon him.
And tender preservation of our person,
And do submit me to your Highness' mercy.
And sworn unto the practices of France
And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
And other devils that suggest by treasons
And tell the legions 'I can never win
And but in purged judgment trusting neither?
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot
Another fall of man. Their faults are open.
And God acquit them of their practices!
And I repent my fault more than my death;  
And his whole kingdom into desolation.
And we must earn therefore.
And Holdfast is the only dog, my duck.
And more than carefully it us concerns
And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,
And let us do it with no show of fear-
And you shall find his vanities forespent
And, Princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.
And he is bred out of that bloody strain
And all our princes capdv'd by the hand
And all wide-stretched honours that pertain,
And when you find him evenly deriv'd
And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,
And anything that may not misbecome
And be assur'd you'll find a difference,
And these he masters now. Now he weighs time
And leave your England as dead midnight still,
And down goes an before them. Still be kind,
And eke out our performance with your mind.             Exit
And sheath'd their swords for lack of argument.
And teach them how to war. And you, good yeomen,
And sword and shield
And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart,
And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls;  
And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French;
And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.
And overlook their grafters?
And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine,
And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos,
And that we are most lofty runaways.
And in a captive chariot into Rouen
And for achievement offer us his ransom.
And let him say to England that we send
And quickly bring us word of England's fall.          Exeunt
And of buxom valour, hath by cruel fate
And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel,
And let not hemp his windpipe suffocate.
And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut
And tell thy king I do not seek him now,
And on to-morrow bid them march away.                 Exeunt
And the third hour of drowsy morning name.
And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night
And calls them brothers, friends, and countrymen.
And so our scene must to the battle fly;
And preachers to us all, admonishing
And make a moral of the devil himself.
And when the mind is quick'ned, out of doubt
And then I would no other company.
And what have kings that privates have not too,
And what art thou, thou idol Ceremony?
And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!
And follows so the ever-running year
And but for ceremony, such a wretch,
And on it have bestowed more contrite tears
And dout them with superfluous courage, ha!
And your fair show shall suck away their souls,
And sheathe for lack of sport. Let us but blow on them,
And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound
And our air shakes them passing scornfully;
And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps.
And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal'd bit
And their executors, the knavish crows,
And give their fasting horses provender,
And after fight with them?
And use it for my haste. Come, come, away!
And my kind kinsman- warriors all, adieu!
And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it,
And crowns for convoy put into his purse;
And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian.'
And say 'These wounds I had on Crispian's day.'
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,
And gentlemen in England now-a-bed
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
And will with all expedience charge on us.
And those that leave their valiant bones in France,
And draw their honours reeking up to heaven,
And time hath worn us into slovenry.
And my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night
And turn them out of service. If they do this-
And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day!          Exeunt
Another part of the field of battle
And he that will not follow Bourbon now,
Another part of the field
And takes him by the beard, kisses the gashes
And, with a feeble grip, says 'Dear my lord,
And so, espous'd to death, with blood he seal'd
And all my mother came into mine eyes
And gave me up to tears.
Another part of the field
And make them skirr away as swift as stones
And not a man of them that we shall take
And gallop o'er the field.
And touch'd with choler, hot as gunpowder,
And quickly will return an injury;
And thou hast given me most bitter terms.
And give it to this fellow. Keep it, fellow;
And wear it for an honour in thy cap
And, Captain, you must needs be friends with him.
And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead
And gentlemen of blood and quality.
And Edward Duke of Bar. Of lusty earls,
And not to us, but to thy arm alone,
And be it death proclaimed through our host
And then to Calais; and to England then;
And solemnly see him set on to London.
And there my rendezvous is quite cut off.  
And something lean to cutpurse of quick hand.
And patches will I get unto these cudgell'd scars,
And swear I got them in the Gallia wars.                Exit
And, as a branch and member of this royalty,
And, princes French, and peers, health to you all!
And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,
And as our vineyards, fallows, meads, and hedges,
And everything that seems unnatural.
And bless us with her former qualities.
And brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester,
And take with you free power to ratify,
Any thing in or out of our demands;
And we'll consign thereto. Will you, fair sister,
And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
And thereupon give me your daughter.
And all the peers', for surety of our leagues.
And may our oaths well kept and prosp'rous be!
And of it left his son imperial lord.
And with them scourge the bad revolting stars
And death's dishonourable victory
And lookest to command the Prince and realm.
And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st,
And none but women left to wail the dead.
And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,
Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;
An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,  
And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.
And Lord Scales with him, and Lord Hungerford;
And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,
And then I will proclaim young Henry king.              Exit
And for his safety there I'll best devise.              Exit
And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.             Exeunt
And have their provender tied to their mouths,
And he may well in fretting spend his gall
And hunger will enforce them to be more eager.
And drive the English forth the bounds of France.
And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,
And in a vision full of majesty
And free my country from calamity  
And whereas I was black and swart before,
And I will answer unpremeditated.
And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.
And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true;
And fightest with the sword of Deborah.
And not Protector of the King or realm.
And would have armour here out of the Tower,
And how the English have the suburbs won.
And thence discover how with most advantage
And even these three days have I watch'd
And thou shalt find me at the Governor's.               Exit
And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground
And spurn in pieces posts of adamant;
And if I did but stir out of my bed,
And view the Frenchmen how they fortify.
And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.
And then we'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.
And straightway give thy soul to him thou serv'st.
And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder,
And feast and banquet in the open streets
And all the priests and friars in my realm
And now there rests no other shift but this
And lay new platforms to endamage them.  
And here advance it in the market-place,
And that hereafter ages may behold
And what a terror he had been to France.
And therefore tell her I return great thanks  
And in submission will attend on her.
And I have heard it said unbidden guests
And when you have done so, bring the keys to me.
And his achievements of no less account.
And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.
And for that cause I train'd thee to my house.
And I will chain these legs and arms of thine
And sent our sons and husbands captivate.
And least proportion of humanity.
And in a moment makes them desolate.
And more than may be gathered by thy shape.
And never yet could frame my will to it;
And therefore frame the law unto my will.
And stands upon the honour of his birth,
And say withal I think he held the right.
And fall on my side so, against your will.
And keep me on the side where still I am.  
And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.
And by his treason stand'st not thou attainted,
And till thou be restor'd thou art a yeoman.
And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,
And know us by these colours for thy foes
And so farewell until I meet thee next.                 Exit
And if thou be not then created York,
And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,
And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,
And pithless arms, like to a withered vine
And answer was return'd that he will come.
And even since then hath Richard been obscur'd,
And in his bosom spend my latter gasp.
And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,
And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease.
And did upbraid me with my father's death;
And for alliance sake, declare the cause  
And hath detain'd me all my flow'ring youth
And death approach not ere my tale be done.
And have install'd me in the diadem;
And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,
And that my fainting words do warrant death.
And like a mountain not to be remov'd.
And so, farewell; and fair be all thy hopes,
And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!          [Dies]
And like a hermit overpass'd thy days.
And what I do imagine, let that rest.
And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,
And therefore haste I to the Parliament,
And for thy treachery, what's more manifest
And for dissension, who preferreth peace
And that engenders thunder in his breast
And makes him roar these accusations forth.
And useth it to patronage his theft.
And know the office that belongs to such.
And, banding themselves in contrary parts,  
And we for fear compell'd to shut our shops.
And set this unaccustom'd fight aside.
And ere that we will suffer such a prince,
And have our bodies slaught'red by thy foes.
And if you love me, as you say you do,
And will not you maintain the thing you teach,
An if your Grace mark every circumstance,
And humble service till the point of death.
And in reguerdon of that duty done
And rise created princely Duke of York.
And as my duty springs, so perish they
And will at last break out into a flame;
And now I fear that fatal prophecy.
And Henry born at Windsor should lose all.
And that we find the slothful watch but weak,
And we be lords and rulers over Rouen;
And once again we'll sleep secure in Rouen.
And then do execution on the watch. Alarum.           Exeunt
An alarum. Enter TALBOT in an excursion
An alarum; excursions. BEDFORD brought in sick in  
And make thee curse the harvest of that corn.
And run a tilt at death within a chair?
And twit with cowardice a man half dead?  
And dare not take up arms like gentlemen.
And I, as sure as English Henry lives
And as his father here was conqueror,
And will be partner of your weal or woe.
And now no more ado, brave Burgundy,
And set upon our boasting enemy.
An alarum; excursions. Enter SIR JOHN FASTOLFE,
An alarum. Re-enter TALBOT, BURGUNDY, and the rest
And then depart to Paris to the King,
And like a peacock sweep along his tail;
And of thy cunning had no diffidence;
And we will make thee famous through the world.
And have thee reverenc'd like a blessed saint.  
And not have tide of an earldom here.
And all the troops of English after him.
And see the cities and the towns defac'd
And wash away thy country's stained spots.
And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill,
And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?
And was he not in England prisoner?
And join'st with them will be thy slaughtermen.
And made me almost yield upon my knees.
And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace.
And doth deserve a coronet of gold.
And seek how we may prejudice the foe.                Exeunt
And with submissive loyalty of heart
And in our coronation take your place.
And, after, meet you sooner than you would.           Exeunt
And none your foes but such as shall pretend
And that the French were almost ten to one,
And ill beseeming any common man,
And should, if I were worthy to be judge,
And now, my Lord Protector, view the letter
And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.'
And give him chastisement for this abuse.
And what offence it is to flout his friends.
And wherefore crave you combat, or with whom?
And in defence of my lord's worthiness,
And he first took exceptions at this badge,
And then your Highness shall command a peace.
And perish ye, with your audacious prate!
And you, my lords- methinks you do not well
And you, my lords, remember where we are:
And that within ourselves we disagree,
And, therefore, as we hither came in peace,  
And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite
And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,
And thus he would open your city gates,
And do him homage as obedient subjects,
And I'll withdraw me and my bloody power;
And strong enough to issue out and fight.
And no way canst thou turn thee for redress
And pale destruction meets thee in the face.
And mine shall ring thy dire departure out.             Exit
And make the cowards stand aloof at bay.
And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends.
And I am louted by a traitor villain
And cannot help the noble chevalier.  
And hemm'd about with grim destruction.
And on his son, young John, who two hours since
And now they meet where both their lives are done.
And whiles the honourable captain there
And, in advantage ling'ring, looks for rescue,
And Talbot perisheth by your default.
And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending.
And fly would Talbot never, though he might.
And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape
And shall I fly? O, if you love my mother,
And soul with soul from France to heaven fly.         Exeunt
And left us to the rage of France his sword.
And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee.
And, interchanging blows, I quickly shed
And misbegotten blood I spill of thine,
And like me to the peasant boys of France,
An if I fly, I am not Talbot's son;
And, commendable prov'd, let's die in pride.          Exeunt
Another part of the field
And like a hungry lion did commence
And in that sea of blood my boy did drench
Anon, from thy insulting tyranny,
And to survey the bodies of the dead.
And give them burial as beseems their worth.
And now to Paris in this conquering vein!
And stablish quietness on every side.
And surer bind this knot of amity,  
And fitter is my study and my books
And call'd unto a cardinal's degree?
And therefore are we certainly resolv'd
And so, my Lord Protector, see them guarded
And safely brought to Dover; where inshipp'd,
And turn again unto the warlike French.
And keep not back your powers in dalliance.
And happiness to his accomplices!
And means to give you battle presently.
And ye choice spirits that admonish me
And give me signs of future accidents;             [Thunder]
And let her head fall into England's lap.
And hell too strong for me to buckle with.
And try if they can gain your liberty.
And may ye both be suddenly surpris'd
And lay them gently on thy tender side.
And peace established between these realms.
And our nobility will scorn the match.
And will not any way dishonour me.
And then I need not crave his courtesy.
And set a precious crown upon thy head,
And have no portion in the choice myself.
And, madam, at your father's castle walls
And this her easy-held imprisonment
And those two counties I will undertake
And make this marriage to be solemniz'd.
And natural graces that extinguish art;
And, now it is my chance to find thee out,
And for thy sake have I shed many a tear.
And here at hand the Dauphin and his train
And sold their bodies for their country's benefit,
An suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,
And, Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear
And still enjoy thy regal dignity.
And yet, in substance and authority,
And therein reverenc'd for their lawful king.
And now the matter grows to compromise
And not of any challenge of desert,
And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
And therefore take this compact of a truce,
And like as rigour of tempestuous gusts
And, which is more, she is not so divine,
And not deface your honour with reproach?
And therefore may be broke without offence.  
And of such great authority in France
And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.
And not to seek a queen to make him rich.
And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,
An age of discord and continual strife?
And is a pattern of celestial peace.
And you, good uncle, banish all offence:
And so conduct me where, from company,
And humbly now upon my bended knee,
And over-joy of heart doth minister.
And dimm'd mine eyes, that I can read no further.
And girt thee with the sword. Cousin of York,
And did my brother Bedford toil his wits
And had his Highness in his infancy
And shall these labours and these honours die?  
Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both;
And are the cities that I got with wounds
And our King Henry gives away his own
And no great friend, I fear me, to the King.
And heir apparent to the English crown.
And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,
And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,
And greatness of his place be grief to us,
And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland,  
And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds
And common profit of his country!
And would have kept so long as breath did last.
And purchase friends, and give to courtezans,
And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof,
Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!
And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts,
And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,
And when I spy advantage, claim the crown,
And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars;  
And in my standard bear the arms of York,
And force perforce I'll make him yield the crown,
And having both together heav'd it up,
And never more abase our sight so low
And may that thought, when I imagine ill
And on the pieces of the broken wand
And William de la Pole, first Duke of Suffolk.
And in that chair where kings and queens were crown'd;
And on my head did set the diadem.
And the Protector's wife, belov'd of him?
And wilt thou still be hammering treachery
And not be check'd.
And smooth my way upon their headless necks;
And, being a woman, I will not be slack
And will they undertake to do me good?
And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk;
And buzz these conjurations in her brain.
And her attainture will be Humphrey's fall
And this the royalty of Albion's king?
And must be made a subject to a duke?
And stol'st away the ladies' hearts of France,
And set the triple crown upon his head;
And grumbling York; and not the least of these
And in her heart she scorns our poverty;
And plac'd a quire of such enticing birds
And never mount to trouble you again.
And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.
And at his pleasure will resign my place.
And all the peers and nobles of the realm
And left thee to the mercy of the law.
And listen after Humphrey, how he proceeds.  
And that your Majesty was an usurper.
And let these have a day appointed them
And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves-
And kept asunder. You, madam, shall with us.
And hardly understood.
And ten to one old Joan had not gone out.
And what a pitch she flew above the rest!
And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.
An't like your lordly Lord's Protectorship.
And made me climb, With danger of my life.
And other of your Highness' Privy Council,
And, vanquish'd as I am, I yield to the
And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.  
And for my wife I know not how it stands.
And give her as a prey to law and shame,
And call these foul offenders to their answers,
And poise the cause in justice' equal scales,
And left behind him Richard, his only son,
And him to Pomfret, where, as all you know,
And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,
And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.
And in this private plot be we the first
And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,
And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.
And go in peace, Humphrey, no less belov'd
And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it
And Humphrey Duke of Gloucester scarce himself,
And ready are the appellant and defendant,
And God in justice hath reveal'd to us
And after summer evermore succeeds
And nod their heads and throw their eyes on thee;
And, in thy closet pent up, rue my shame
And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine!
And thou a prince, Protector of this land,
And follow'd with a rabble that rejoice
And when I start, the envious people laugh
And bid me be advised how I tread.
And he a prince, and ruler of the land;
And York, and impious Beaufort, that false priest,
And, fly thou how thou canst, they'll tangle thee.
And had I twenty times so many foes,
And each of them had twenty times their power,
And Sir John Stanley is appointed now
And I may live to do you kindness if
And shall I then be us'd reproachfully?
And go we to attire you for our journey.
And show itself, attire me how I can.
And if we did but glance a far-off look
And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,  
And Humphrey is no little man in England.
And should you fall he is the next will mount;
And his advantage following your decease-
And when he please to make commotion,
And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.
And had I first been put to speak my mind,
And such high vaunts of his nobility,
And in his simple show he harbours treason.
And caterpillars eat my leaves away;
And, being Protector, stay'd the soldiers' pay;
And never ask'd for restitution.
And lowly words were ransom for their fault.
And here commit you to my Lord Cardinal
And charity chas'd hence by rancour's hand;
And equity exil'd your Highness' land.
And if my death might make this island happy
And prove the period of their tyranny,
And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate;
And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,
And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,
And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up
And all to make away my guiltless life.
And the offender granted scope of speech,
And well such losers may have leave to speak.
And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.
And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come
And as the butcher takes away the calf,  
And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,
And as the dam runs lowing up and down,
And can do nought but wail her darling's loss,
And yet herein I judge mine own wit good-
And yet we have but trivial argument,
And do not stand on quillets how to slay him;
And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,
And I'll provide his executioner-
And put the Englishmen unto the sword.
And temper clay with blood of Englishmen;
And try your hap against the Irishmen?
And what we do establish he confirms;
And so break off; the day is almost spent.
And change misdoubt to resolution;
And find no harbour in a royal heart.
And not a thought but thinks on dignity.
And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
And for a minister of my intent
And fought so long tiff that his thighs with darts
And in the end being rescu'd, I have seen
And undiscover'd come to me again
And given me notice of their villainies.
And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;
And Henry put apart, the next for me.                   Exit
And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,
And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight;
And for myself- foe as he was to me-
And all to have the noble Duke alive.  
And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.
And make my image but an alehouse sign.
And twice by awkward wind from England's bank
And he that loos'd them forth their brazen caves;
And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,
And would not dash me with their ragged sides,
And when the dusky sky began to rob  
And threw it towards thy land. The sea receiv'd it;
And so I wish'd thy body might my heart.
And even with this I lost fair England's view,
And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,
And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles
And care not who they sting in his revenge.
And comment then upon his sudden death.
And with my fingers feel his hand un-feeling;
And to survey his dead and earthy image,
And tugg'd for life, and was by strength subdu'd.
And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.
And you, forsooth, had the good Duke to keep.
And 'tis well seen he found an enemy.
And sees fast by a butcher with an axe,
And never of the Nevils' noble race.  
And I should rob the deathsman of his fee,
And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild,
And say it was thy mother that thou meant'st,
And, after all this fearful homage done,
And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost.
And he but naked, though lock'd up in steel,  
And torture him with grievous ling'ring death.
And mere instinct of love and loyalty,
And charge that no man should disturb your rest,
And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,
And had I not been cited so by them,
And therefore by His Majesty I swear,
And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!  
And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave.
And even now my burden'd heart would break,
And boding screech-owls make the consort full!
And these dread curses, like the sun 'gainst glass,
And turns the force of them upon thyself.
And think it but a minute spent in sport.
And banished I am, if but from thee.
And where thou art not, desolation.  
And whispers to his pillow, as to him,
And I am sent to tell his Majesty
And with the southern clouds contend in tears-
And in thy sight to die, what were it else
And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,
And then it liv'd in sweet Elysium.
And from his bosom purge this black despair!
And let us all to meditation.                         Exeunt
And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades
And thou that art his mate make boot of this;
And bear the name and port of gentlemen?
And so should these, if I might have my will.
And told me that by water I should die;
And I proclaim'd a coward through the world.
And thought thee happy when I shook my head?
And duly waited for my coming forth.
And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.
And thou that smil'dst at good Duke Humphrey's death
And wedded be thou to the hags of hell
And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorg'd
And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home.
And now the house of York- thrust from the crown
And lofty proud encroaching tyranny-
And to conclude, reproach and beggary
And all by thee. Away! convey him hence.
And sooner dance upon a bloody pole
And thou thyself a shearman, art thou not?
And, ignorant of his birth and parentage,
And you that be the King's friends, follow me.
Another part of Blackheath
And makes it fearful and degenerate;
And could it not enforce them to relent
And calls your Grace usurper, openly,
And vows to crown himself in Westminster.
And therefore in this city will I stay
And live alone as secret as I may.
And therefore am I bold and resolute.                 Exeunt
And thither I will send you Matthew Goffe;
And so, farewell, for I must hence again.             Exeunt
And seeing ignorance is the curse of God,
And therefore yet relent and save my life.
And therefore yet relent, and save my life.
And here pronounce free pardon to them all
And yield to mercy whilst 'tis offer'd you,
And you, base peasants, do ye believe him? Will you needs be
And make the meanest of you earls and dukes?
And he that brings his head unto the King
And could command no more content than I?
And humbly thus, with halters on their necks,
And show'd how well you love your Prince and country.
And Henry, though he be infortunate,
And so, with thanks and pardon to you all,
And with a puissant and a mighty power
And still proclaimeth, as he comes along,
And now is York in arms to second him.
And ask him what's the reason of these arms.
And Somerset, we will commit thee thither
And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?
And sends the poor well pleased from my gate.
And like a thief to come to rob my grounds,
And if mine arm be heaved in the air,
And hang thee o'er my tomb when I am dead.
And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,
And there cut off thy most ungracious head,
And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head:
And now, like Ajax Telamonius,
And let my sovereign, virtuous Henry,
And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,
And will that thou thenceforth attend on us.
And never live but true unto his liege!
And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.
And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.
And with the same to act controlling laws.
And chop away that factious pate of his.
And manacle the berard in their chains,
And such a piece of service will you do,
And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?
And shame thine honourable age with blood?
And in my conscience do repute his Grace
And have no other reason for this wrong
And that I'll write upon thy burgonet,
And tread it under foot with all contempt,
And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear,
And dead men's cries do fill the empty air,
And made a prey for carrion kites and crows
And the premised flames of the last day
And in thy reverence and thy chair-days thus
And beauty, that the tyrant oft reclaims,
And where this breach now in our fortunes made
And, like a gallant in the brow of youth,
And like rich hangings in a homely house,
And it hath pleas'd Him that three times to-day
And more such days as these to us befall!             Exeunt
And this the regal seat. Possess it, York;
And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.
And bashful Henry depos'd, whose cowardice
And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge
And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?
And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;
And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.
And slew your fathers, and with colours spread
And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.
And seiz'd upon their towns and provinces.
And be you silent and attentive too,
And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,
And made him to resign his crown perforce.
And over the chair of state, where now he sits,
And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou liv'st.
And die in bands for this unmanly deed!
And neither by treason nor hostility
And never seen thee, never borne thee son,
And disinherited thine only son.
And giv'n unto the house of York such head  
And creep into it far before thy time?
And yet shalt thou be safe? Such safety finds
And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself,
And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace  
And utter ruin of the house of York.
And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.
And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.
And tell him privily of our intent.
And yet the King not privy to my drift,
And therefore fortify your hold, my lord.
And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.
And thus most humbly I do take my leave.                Exit
And issue forth and bid them battle straight.
And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,
And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder.
And not with such a cruel threat'ning look!
And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,
And till I root out their accursed line
And leave not one alive, I live in hell.  
And when I give occasion of offence
And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade
Another part of the field
And all my followers to the eager foe
And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out.'
And full as oft came Edward to my side
And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!
And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
And I am faint and cannot fly their fury;
And were I strong, I would not shun their fury.
And made an evening at the noontide prick.
And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,
And in thy thought o'errun my former time;
And, if thou canst for blushing, view this face,
And bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice
And ten to one is no impeach of valour.
And made a preachment of your high descent?
And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,
And if thine eyes can water for his death,
And I to make thee mad do mock thee thus.
And this is he was his adopted heir.
And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,
And rob his temples of the diadem,
And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.
And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?
And when the rage allays, the rain begins.
And every drop cries vengeance for his death
And I with tears do wash the blood away.
And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,
And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'
And in thy need such comfort come to thee
And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.
And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.
And takes her farewell of the glorious sun.
And overshine the earth, as this the world.
And stood against them as the hope of Troy
And many strokes, though with a little axe,  
And after many scorns, many foul taunts,
And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,
And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.
And now, to add more measure to your woes,
And very well appointed, as I thought,
And we in them no hope to win the day;
And when came George from Burgundy to England?
And for your brother, he was lately sent
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,
And wrap our bodies in black mourning-gowns,
And therefore comes my brother Montague.
And of their feather many moe proud birds,
And now to London all the crew are gone
And once again bestride our foaming steeds,
And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'
And when thou fail'st- as God forbid the hour!-
And he that throws not up his cap for joy
And craves your company for speedy counsel.  
And harmful pity must be laid aside.
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
And raise his issue like a loving sire:
And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,
And long hereafter say unto his child
And let his manly face, which promiseth
And happy always was it for that son
And would my father had left me no more!
And this soft courage makes your followers faint.
And learn this lesson: Draw thy sword in right.
And in that quarrel use it to the death.
And in the towns, as they do march along,
And hearten those that fight in your defence.
And set thy diadem upon my head,
And ne'er was Agamemmon's brother wrong'd  
And tam'd the King, and made the Dauphin stoop;
And had he match'd according to his state,
And grac'd thy poor sire with his bridal day,
And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.
And we, in pity of the gentle King,
And that thy summer bred us no increase,
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,
And either victory or else a grave!
And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.
And weak we are, and cannot shun pursuit.
And in the very pangs of death he cried,
And look upon, as if the tragedy  
And in this vow do chain my soul to thine!
And ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face
And give sweet passage to my sinful soul.
And give them leave to fly that will not stay,
And call them pillars that will stand to us;
And if we thrive, promise them such rewards
Another part of the field
And this for Rutland; both bound to revenge,
And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;
And here's the heart that triumphs in their death
And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
And so, have at thee!                           [They fight]
Another part of the field
And to conclude: the shepherd's homely curds,
And I, that haply take them from him now,
And I, who at his hands receiv'd my life,
And pardon, father, for I knew not thee.
And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.  
And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war,
And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!
And so obsequious will thy father be,
And Warwick rages like a chafed bull.
And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,
Another part of the field
And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts,
And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.  
And, whereso'er he is, he's surely dead.
And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.
And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.
And rear it in the place your father's stands.
And now to London with triumphant march,
And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen.  
And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread
And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea
And never will I undertake the thing
And George, of Clarence; Warwick, as ourself,
And in this covert will we make our stand,
And, for the time shall not seem tedious,
And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick
And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.  
And Nero will be tainted with remorse
And in conclusion wins the King from her
And men may talk of kings, and why not I?
And we his subjects, sworn in all allegiance,
And you were sworn true subjects unto me;
And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?
And as the air blows it to me again,
And yielding to another when it blows,
And be you kings: command, and I'll obey.
And what God will, that let your King perform;
And what he will, I humbly yield unto.                Exeunt
And come some other time to know our mind.
And what your pleasure is shall satisfy me.
An if what pleases him shall pleasure you.
And she shall be my love, or else my queen.
And that is to enjoy thee for my love.
And yet too good to be your concubine.
And, by God's Mother, I, being but a bachelor,
Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.
And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.
And go we, brothers, to the man that took him
And yet, between my soul's desire and me-
And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,
And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,
And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;
And so I say I'll cut the causes off,
And deck my body in gay ornaments,
And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.
And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,
And am I, then, a man to be belov'd?
And whiles I live t' account this world but hell,
And yet I know not how to get the crown,
And I- like one lost in a thorny wood
And from that torment I will free myself
And cry 'Content!' to that which grieves my heart,
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,  
And frame my face to all occasions.
And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.
And set the murderous Machiavel to school.
And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.
And with dishonour laid me on the ground,
And to my humble seat conform myself.
And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.  
And sit thee by our side. [Seats her by him] Yield not thy neck
And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.
And forc'd to live in Scotland a forlorn;
And if thou fail us, all our hope is done.
And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.
And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!
And then to crave a league of amity,
And lastly to confirm that amity
And thou no more art prince than she is queen.
And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
And not betray thy treason with a blush?
And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,
And better 'twere you troubled him than France.
And, madam, these for you; from whom I know not.
And now, to soothe your forgery and his,
And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,  
And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?
And to repair my honour lost for him
And henceforth I am thy true servitor.
And replant Henry in his former state.
And I forgive and quite forget old faults,
And joy that thou becom'st King Henry's friend.
And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,
And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
And I am ready to put armour on.
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.
And, as occasion serves, this noble Queen
And Prince shall follow with a fresh supply.
And with thy hand thy faith irrevocable
And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.
And thou, Lord Bourbon, our High Admiral,
And I'll be chief to bring him down again;
And you too, Somerset and Montague,
And with their helps only defend ourselves.
And for this once my will shall stand for law.
And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.
And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.
And not be tied unto his brother's will.
And meaner than myself have had like fortune.
And their true sovereign whom they must obey?
And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.
And I am ready to put armour on.'
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'
And haste is needful in this desp'rate case.
And welcome, Somerset. I hold it cowardice
And now what rests but, in night's coverture,
And but attended by a simple guard,
And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,
And seize himself- I say not 'slaughter him,'
And come now to create you Duke of York.
And be true King indeed; thou but the shadow.
And see him seated in the regal throne.               Exeunt
And, as I further have to understand,
And I the rather wean me from despair  
And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross;
And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,
And often but attended with weak guard
And pray that I may repossess the crown.              Exeunt
And turn'd my captive state to liberty,
And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;
And that the people of this blessed land
And now may seem as wise as virtuous
And therefore I yield thee my free consent.
And in devotion spend my latter days,
And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful
And all his lands and goods confiscated.  
And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.
And the Lord Hastings, who attended him
And from the Bishop's huntsmen rescu'd him;
And we shall have more wars befor't be long.
And says that once more I shall interchange
And brought desired help from Burgundy;
And shut the gates for safety of ourselves,
And all those friends that deign to follow me.
And Henry but usurps the diadem.
And now will I be Edward's champion.
And when the morning sun shall raise his car
And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.        Exeunt
And with his troops doth march amain to London;
And many giddy people flock to him.
And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well belov'd,
And all at once, once more a happy farewell.
And, when the lion fawns upon the lamb,
And once again proclaim us King of England.
And swell so much the higher by their ebb.
And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course,
And take the great-grown traitor unawares.
And by thy guess how nigh is Clarence now?
And do expect him here some two hours hence.
And he shall pardon thee these outrages.
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.  
And, weakling, Warwick takes his gift again;
And Henry is my King, Warwick his subject.
And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:
And ten to one you'll meet him in the Tower.
And with the other fling it at thy face,
And thou shalt be the third, if this sword hold.
And set up Lancaster. Why, trowest thou, Warwick,
And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,
And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.
And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,
And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou dar'st.
And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
And kept low shrubs from winter's pow'rful wind.
And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow?
And live we how we can, yet die we must.
And with thy lips keep in my soul a while!
And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,
And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.'
And more he would have said; and more he spoke,
Another part of the field
And we are grac'd with wreaths of victory.
And, as we hear, march on to fight with us.
And blow it to the source from whence it came;
And Somerset, with Oxford, fled to her.
And as we march our strength will be augmented
And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood;
And give more strength to that which hath too much;
And Montague our top-mast; what of him?
And Somerset another goodly mast?
And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I
And what is Edward but a ruthless sea?
And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?
And make him naked foil a man-at-arms.
And make him of the like spirit to himself.
And warriors faint! Why, 'twere perpetual shame.
And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.
Another part of the field
And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?
And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster.
And thou misshapen Dick, I tell ye all
And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.
And men ne'er spend their fury on a child.
And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.
And see our gentle queen how well she fares.
And both preposterous; therefore, not 'good lord.'
And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.
And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,  
And yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.
And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand
And many an old man's sigh, and many a widow's,
And many an orphan's water-standing eye-
And chatt'ring pies in dismal discords sung;
And yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,
And if the rest be true which I have heard,  
And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?  
And so I was, which plainly signified
And this word 'love,' which greybeards call divine,
And not in me! I am myself alone.
And then to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.
And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.  
And two Northumberlands- two braver men
And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.
And made our footstool of security.
And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.
And heave it shall some weight or break my back.
And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.
And cried 'All hail!' when as he meant all harm.
And hither have they sent it for her ransom.
And now what rests but that we spend the time
And follow'd with the general throng and sweat
And if you can be merry then, I'll say
And keep it from the earth.
And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
And let your reason with your choler question
And from a mouth of honour quite cry down
And lose by over-running. Know you not
And proofs as clear as founts in July when
And pav'd with gold, the Emperor thus desir'd,
And break the foresaid peace. Let the King know,
And for his own advantage.
And point by point the treasons of his master
And those of true condition, that your subjects
And lack of other means, in desperate manner
And danger serves among them.
And with a care exempt themselves from fear:
And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?
And though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,
And pardon comes. I shall anon advise you
And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,
And spoil your nobler soul. I say, take heed;
And this man out of prison?
Another spread on's breast, mounting his eyes,
And never see the Louvre.
And understand again like honest men,
An honest country lord, as I am, beaten
And have an hour of hearing; and, by'r Lady,
And thank your lordship. By your leave, sweet ladies.
And to you all, good health!                             [Drinks]
And save me so much talking.
And to what end, is this? Nay, ladies, fear not:
And hither make, as great ambassadors
And pray receive 'em nobly and conduct 'em
An hour of revels with 'em.
And not to kiss you. A health, gentlemen!
And so his peers, upon this evidence,
And something spoke in choler, ill and hasty;
And generally: whoever the King favours
And far enough from court too.
And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.  
And by that name must die; yet, heaven bear witness,
And if I have a conscience, let it sink me
And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,
And as the long divorce of steel falls on me
And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, a God's name.
And if he speak of Buckingham, pray tell him
And when old time Shall lead him to his end,  
And fit it with such furniture as suits
And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun.
And with that blood will make 'em one day groan fort.
And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!  
And must needs say a noble one; which makes me
And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
And when you would say something that is sad,
And merely to revenge him on the Emperor
And with what zeal! For, now he has crack'd the league
And out of all these to restore the King,
And every true heart weeps for 't. All that dare
And with some other business put the King
And thank the holy conclave for their loves.
And, fearing he would rise, he was so virtuous,
And range with humble livers in content
And wear a golden sorrow.
And venture maidenhead for 't; and so would you,
And say I spoke with you.
And leave me out on't. Would I had no being,
And on all sides th' authority allow'd;
And to bestow your pity on me; for
And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,
And process of this time, you can report,
And prove it too against mine honour, aught,
And unmatch'd wit and judgment; Ferdinand,
And of your choice, these reverend fathers-men
And that, without delay, their arguments
And worthily, my falsehood! Yea, as much
And to say so no more.
And to be judg'd by him.
And like her true nobility she has
And thus far clear him. Now, what mov'd me to't,
And press'd in with this caution. First, methought
And doctors learn'd. First, I began in private
And consequence of dread-that I committed
And did entreat your Highness to this course
And kingly dignity, we are contented
And the mountain tops that freeze,
And service to his Majesty and you,
And comforts to your cause.  
And to such men of gravity and learning,
And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends,
And all such false professors! Would you have me-
And all the fellowship I hold now with him
And am I thus rewarded? 'Tis not well, lords.  
And to that woman, when she has done most,
And force them with a constancy, the Cardinal
Anything on him; for he hath a witchcraft
And came to th' eye o' th' King; wherein was read
And hedges his own way. But in this point
And let him cry 'Ha!' louder!
And widow to Prince Arthur.
Anne Bullen! No, I'll no Anne Bullens for him;
And well deserving? Yet I know her for
An heretic, an arch one, Cranmer; one
And is his oracle.
And fix'd on spiritual object, he should still
And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well;
And yet words are no deeds. My father lov'd you:
And, if you may confess it, say withal
And throw it from their soul; though perils did
And stand unshaken yours.
And after, this; and then to breakfast with
And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence,
And from that full meridian of my glory
And no man see me more.
And an that love his follies.
And from this fellow? If we live thus tamely,
And dare us with his cap like larks.
And spotless shall mine innocence arise,
And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;  
And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
And then he falls, as I do. I have ventur'd,
And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
And when I am forgotten, as I shall be,
And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention
And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,
And my integrity to heaven, is all
And, to be short, for not appearance and
And the late marriage made of none effect;
And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.
And more and richer, when he strains that lady;
And sometimes falling ones.
And make 'em reel before 'em. No man living
And with the same full state pac'd back again
And one, already, of the Privy Council.
An old man, broken with the storms of state,
And yet with charity. He was a man
And though he were unsatisfied in getting-
And found the blessedness of being little.
And, to add greater honours to his age  
And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?
And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel
And of an earthly cold! Mark her eyes.
And heartily entreats you take good comfort.
And now I should not lie-but will deserve,
And sure those men are happy that shall have 'em.  
And something over to remember me by.
And able means, we had not parted thus.
And durst commend a secret to your ear
And, let me tell you, it will ne'er be well-
And princely care, foreseeing those fell mischiefs
And we must root him out. From your affairs
And am right sorry to repeat what follows.
And am right glad to catch this good occasion
And corn shall fly asunder; for I know
And woo your own destruction.
And do as I have bid you.
And of a lovely boy. The God of Heaven
An ordinary groom is for such payment.
And at the door too, like a post with packets.
And has done half an hour, to know your pleasures.
And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us,
And, not reform'd, may prove pernicious.
And with no little study, that my teaching
And the strong course of my authority
And freely urge against me.
And by that virtue no man dare accuse you.
And our consent, for better trial of you,
And see him safe i' th' Tower.
And his disciples only envy at-
And think with wagging of your tongue to win me;
And wisdom of my Council; but I find none.
And fair purgation to the world, than malice,
And Lady Marquis Dorset. Will these please you?
And brother-love I do it.  
And that I would not for a cow, God save her!
An army cannot rule 'em.
And here ye lie baiting of bombards, when
And all that shall succeed. Saba was never
And hang their heads with sorrow. Good grows with her;
And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.
And so stand fix'd. Peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,
And like a mountain cedar reach his branches
An aged princess; many days shall see her,
And yet no day without a deed to crown it.
And you, good brethren, I am much beholding;
And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords;
And sleep an act or two; but those, we fear,
And say 'twill do, I know within a while
And put the same into young Arthur's hand,
And sullen presage of your own decay.
An honourable conduct let him have-
And wound her honour with this diffidence.
And were our father, and this son like him-
And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,
And in the meantime sojourn'd at my father's;
And if he were, he came into the world
And if she did play false, the fault was hers;
And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,
And I had his, Sir Robert's his, like him;
And if my legs were two such riding-rods,
And, to his shape, were heir to all this land-
And have is have, however men do catch.
And I am I, howe'er I was begot.
And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
And when my knightly stomach is suffic'd,
And then comes answer like an Absey book:
And so, ere answer knows what question would,
And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
And fits the mounting spirit like myself;
And so am I, whether I smack or no;
And not alone in habit and device,
And so doth yours: your fault was not your folly;
And they shall say when Richard me begot,
And fought the holy wars in Palestine,
And for amends to his posterity,
And to rebuke the usurpation
And coops from other lands her islanders-
And confident from foreign purposes-
And then we shall repent each drop of blood
And stir them up against a mightier task.
An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;
And all th' unsettled humours of the land-
And this his son; England was Geffrey's right,
And this is Geffrey's. In the name of God,
And by whose help I mean to chastise it.
An 'a may catch your hide and you alone.
And out of my dear love I'll give thee more
And with her plague; her sin his injury,
And all for her-a plague upon her!
And ready mounted are they to spit forth
And merciless proceeding by these French
And but for our approach those sleeping stones
And now, instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire,
And let us in-your King, whose labour'd spirits,
And king o'er him and all that he enjoys;
And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,
And with a blessed and unvex'd retire,
And leave your children, wives, and you, in peace.
And stalk in blood to our possession?
And if not that, I bring you witnesses:
And make a monster of you.
And let young Arthur, Duke of Britaine, in,
And victory with little loss doth play
And like a jolly troop of huntsmen come
And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men,
And bear possession of our person here,
And till it be undoubted, we do lock
And stand securely on their battlements
And part your mingled colours once again,
And kiss him with a glorious victory.
And lay this Angiers even with the ground;
And when that we have dash'd them to the ground,
And I shall show you peace and fair-fac'd league;
And she again wants nothing, to name want,
And she a fair divided excellence,
And two such shores to two such streams made one,
And give you entrance; but without this match,
And all that we upon this side the sea-
And quarter'd in her heart-he doth espy
And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town
And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,
And this same bias, this commodity,
And why rail I on this commodity?
And say there is no sin but to be rich;
And being rich, my virtue then shall be
And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,  
And let belief and life encounter so
And with the half-blown rose; but Fortune, O!
And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France
And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.
And leave those woes alone which I alone
And our oppression hath made up this league.
And sooth'st up greatness. What a fool art thou,
And dost thou now fall over to my foes?
And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.  
And from Pope Innocent the legate here,
And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,
And blessed shall he be that doth revolt
And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,
And raise the power of France upon his head,
And by disjoining hands hell lose a soul.
And tell me how you would bestow yourself.
And the conjunction of our inward souls
And even before this truce, but new before,
And shall these hands, so lately purg'd of blood,
And make a riot on the gentle brow
And like. a civil war set'st oath to oath.
And may not be performed by thyself,
And being not done, where doing tends to ill,
And falsehood cures, as fire cools fire
And mak'st an oath the surety for thy truth  
And most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear.
And better conquest never canst thou make
And in their rage, I having hold of both,
And pours down mischief. Austria's head lie there,
And ta'en, I fear.
And, ere our coming, see thou shake the bags
And with advantage means to pay thy love;
And, my good friend, thy voluntary oath
And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs;
And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,
And, by my troth, I think thou lov'st me well.
And wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth tread,
And bloody England into England gone,
And I will kiss thy detestable bones,
And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows,
And ring these fingers with thy household worms,
And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust,
And be a carrion monster like thyself.  
And buss thee as thy wife. Misery's love,
And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
And thou shalt be canoniz'd, Cardinal;  
And teaches me to kill or hang myself.
And will again commit them to their bonds,
And, father Cardinal, I have heard you say
And chase the native beauty from his cheek,
And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
And so he'll die; and, rising so again,
And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste,  
And he that stands upon a slipp'ry place
And call them meteors, prodigies, and signs,
And kiss the lips of unacquainted change,
And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
And, O, what better matter breeds for you  
Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,
And bind the boy which you shall find with me
And so I would be here but that I doubt
And I did never ask it you again;
And with my hand at midnight held your head;
And, like the watchful minutes to the hour,
And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;
And call it cunning. Do, an if you will.
And with hot irons must I burn them out.
And quench his fiery indignation
An if an angel should have come to me
And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,
And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;
Any annoyance in that precious sense!
And would not harm me.
And strew'd repentant ashes on his head.
And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert.
And, like a dog that is compell'd to fight,
And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure
And look'd upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.
And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,
And, in the last repeating, troublesome,
And like a shifted wind unto a sail
And oftentimes excusing of a fault
And more, more strong, when lesser is my fear,
And well shall you perceive how willingly
And I do fearfully believe 'tis done  
And find th' inheritance of this poor child,
And she not hear of it?
And here's a prophet that I brought with me
And on that day at noon whereon he says
And others more, going to seek the grave
And thrust thyself into their companies.
And fly like thought from them to me again.
And be thou he.  
And when they talk of him, they shake their heads,
And whisper one another in the ear;
And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,
Another lean unwash'd artificer
And on the winking of authority
And thou, to be endeared to a king,
And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me.
And didst in signs again parley with sin;
And consequently thy rude hand to act
And you have slander'd nature in my form,
And make them tame to their obedience!
And foul imaginary eyes of blood
And this, so sole and so unmatchable,
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,
And breathing to his breathless excellence
And he, long traded in it, makes it seem
And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread
And it shall be as all the ocean,
And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace;
And follow me with speed. I'll to the King;
And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.                Exeunt
And from his Holiness use all your power
And make fair weather in your blust'ring land.
And wild amazement hurries up and down
An empty casket, where the jewel of life
And fright him there, and make him tremble there?
And grapple with him ere he come so nigh.
And I have made a happy peace with him;
And he hath promis'd to dismiss the powers
And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,  
And find no check? Let us, my liege, to arms.
And keep it safe for our remembrance;
And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.
And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear
And heal the inveterate canker of one wound
And is't not pity, O my grieved friends!
And follow unacquainted colours here?
And grapple thee unto a pagan shore,
And not to spend it so unneighbourly!
And great affections wrestling in thy bosom
And with a great heart heave away this storm;  
And even there, methinks, a
